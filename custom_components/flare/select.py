Manual override for the computed day phase - see coordinator.py for
how this feeds back into brightness/colour-temperature.

select.<prefix>flare_phase, options Auto/Morning/Day/Evening/Night,
default Auto - one per schedule instance (coordinator.py's
ScheduleInstance/schedule_instances), set up alongside that instance's
day-phase/curve sensors (sensor.py).

This is the write side of what used to be a single dual-purpose entity
in the live Jinja setup (input_select.day_phase, which downstream
sensors trusted blindly and a person could also click to override) -
splitting read (sensor.adaptive_lighting's phase) from write (this
entity) is deliberate: the old design's docstring-noted wart ("the
precomputed curve doesn't follow a manual override, so they can
disagree") was a direct symptom of one entity trying to be both.

RestoreEntity so an override survives a restart rather than silently
reverting to Auto - matching the rest of this integration's "check
live state fresh, don't invent hidden expiry" style (see
grouping.py's externally_set()), just for the select's own state instead
of a light's.

Self-correcting by default, matching the old system's behaviour: pin
the phase to something other than what's currently computed (e.g.
override Evening -> Day) and it holds there, but only until the
*schedule itself* next moves on (i.e. when computed_phase next changes
from whatever it was at override time) - at that point the override
clears back to Auto on its own, rather than staying pinned forever, so
overriding "Day" during Evening still ends up at Night once Evening
would naturally have ended, not stuck on Day indefinitely. Toggle
switch.<prefix>sticky_phase_override (see switch.py) to disable this
and keep an override until manually cleared instead - read fresh off
that entity's live state each time, not a cached value, the same "check
now, don't remember" style everything else here already uses.
