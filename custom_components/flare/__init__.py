"""
FLARE.

Standalone Home Assistant services for adaptive-lighting computation:
brightness/colour-temperature curve math (curve.py), per-light
grouping - reachability, multiplier bucketing, tolerance checks,
externally-set protection (leaving a light alone once something other
than our own last write has touched it - see write_tracking.py), two-
step transition routing, RGB-vs-colour-temp routing (grouping.py) - and
scene-coverage gap filling, for "apply a scene, then a default for
whatever it doesn't cover" (scenes.py).
`compute_lighting_groups` is a pure planner (returns groups, doesn't
touch any light); `apply_lighting` wraps the same grouping logic and
actually dispatches light.turn_on/turn_off, taking brightness/colour
targets as plain values - it doesn't read any sensor entity itself; see
docs/blueprint.md's "Bring your own sensor" section for how the
blueprint in this repo extracts those values before calling it.
Optionally also sets up day-phase/curve
sensors (sensor.py), a phase-override select (select.py), and the
schedule/curve config as live entities (time.py, number.py, switch.py)
per named sensor added afterwards (Settings -> Devices & Services ->
FLARE Schedules -> Add schedule sensor) - a native replacement for a
Jinja packages/*.yaml setup - see config_flow.py.

Designed to work with the FLARE blueprint in this repo,
but not coupled to it: call any of the services directly from your own
automations/scripts if that's more useful to you. See README.md and
services.yaml (visible in Developer Tools -> Actions) for the full
contract of each service on its own terms.

curve.py, grouping.py, and scenes.py have no Home Assistant
dependency - this file, sensor.py, select.py, number.py, time.py,
switch.py, and coordinator.py are the only places that touch `hass`,
translating between real HA state/registries and the plain functions
those modules expose.
