"""
Scene-coverage gap filling: given a candidate scene and the set of
entities you want a "default" behaviour applied to, works out which of
those entities the scene actually covers - so you can hand covered
ones to the scene and apply your default (adaptive lighting, or
anything else) only to whatever's left.

Ported from what used to be the blueprint's own desired_scene/
scene_covered_entities/scene_valid/scene_active/target_entities
variables - same behaviour, same defaults, just testable Python
instead of inline Jinja. Generic: nothing here is specific to adaptive
lighting, or even to lighting - "apply a scene, then a default for
whatever it doesn't cover" is a reusable pattern on its own.
