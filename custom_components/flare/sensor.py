"""
Day-phase/curve sensors, backed by coordinator.py - a native
replacement for a Jinja `packages/*.yaml` template-sensor setup (see
CLAUDE.md for the live version this ports). One set of these per
schedule instance (see coordinator.py's ScheduleInstance/
schedule_instances) - one per named "sensor" subentry.

Entity IDs are prefixed with the sensor's slugified name (e.g.
sensor.living_room_flare) - see coordinator.py's
schedule_instances(). Every sensor also gets its own device (see
ScheduleInstance.device_info). has_entity_name=True plus name=None (the
idiomatic HA pattern for "the entity that represents the device") lets
it display as just the device's own name ("Upstairs", or "Adaptive
Lighting" by default), so renaming the sensor is one action
(Settings -> Devices -> rename) rather than us reconstructing a name
via string concatenation.

Day-phase, the brightness/colour-temperature "right now" values,
today's four phase-boundary timestamps, and the full-day brightness/
colour curve are all combined into a single sensor.<name>_flare
(state = phase, attributes = phase/brightness/color_temp/morning_start/
day_start/evening_start/night_start/evening_earliest/evening_latest/
points) rather than separate sensors per value - `brightness`/
`color_temp` are exactly the attribute names the blueprint's
`adaptive_sensor` input already reads via state_attr(), matching the
shape the old packages/adaptive_lighting.yaml `sensor.solar_flare`
sensor used, so this is a drop-in for that role. The four boundary
timestamps used to be their own sensor.morning_start/day_start/
evening_start/night_start entities - folded into attributes here
instead (four extra always-on entities per sensor that exist just to be
read as one-off attribute lookups was judged not worth it; a
phase-change automation reads sensor.<name>_flare's phase attribute
directly, and anything that specifically wants a boundary time - the
dashboard card, in particular - reads it off this same entity's
attributes). A standalone day-phase entity was considered and dropped
for the same reason - anything that wants to react to just the phase
changing can use a `platform: state, attribute: phase` trigger on this
entity, no separate entity required. `points` (the 289-sample day curve
the dashboard card renders) used to live on its own sensor.*_curve
entity - folded in here too, since `_unrecorded_attributes` (what keeps
it out of the recorder's 16KB-limited attribute storage) is a plain
per-attribute-name class field, not something that ever needed a
dedicated entity to work.
