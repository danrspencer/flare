Solar adaptive-lighting brightness/colour-temperature schedule.

Curve logic, a direct port of the Jinja macros that used to live in
custom_templates/adaptive_lighting.jinja. Same inputs, same outputs,
just testable with plain pytest instead of having to render templates
to check the math.

Free of Home Assistant except for one colour conversion - see
kelvin_to_rgb, which delegates to homeassistant.util.color rather than
carrying a copy of the same approximation.

All timestamps are unix seconds. Boundary timestamps (morning/day
start/evening start/night start) are today's, computed elsewhere from
the user's input_datetime helpers plus sunset.

    `homeassistant.util.color.color_temperature_to_rgb` is Tanner
    Helland's approximation - it says so in its own docstring - and this
    used to be a hand-written copy of the same formula. The copy was
    checked against it across 1000-10000K and did not differ by a single
    unit on any channel, so it was 25 lines of arithmetic this repo had
    no reason to own.

    What stays ours is the ROUNDING. Home Assistant returns floats;
    www/flare-curve-card.js's kelvinToRgb() rounds with JavaScript's
    Math.round, which is half-UP, while Python's round() is
    half-to-even. Matching it is deliberate but, measured, currently
    unobservable: no integer Kelvin in 1000-10000 produces a channel
    landing on an exact .5, and kelvin_for_phase only ever hands this
    integers. So round() would pass every test today - which is exactly
    why this says so rather than leaving a future reader to "simplify"
    it and assume the equivalence holds for good.

    One behavioural difference from the old copy, and it is an
    improvement: Home Assistant clamps its input to 1000-40000K, where
    the hand-written version extrapolated. Tanner Helland's formula
    isn't meaningful below 1000K, and the Kelvin `number` entities are
    bounded 1000-10000 anyway - but `compute_curve`'s schema is not, so

    phase_at() above is a cascade of `t < boundary` tests in a fixed
    order, which quietly tolerates boundaries set out of order - a
    Morning time later than the Day time, say. Two things follow from
    that cascade, and neither is obvious from the four raw boundaries:

    1. A phase can be UNREACHABLE. With Morning at 10:00 and Day at
       08:00, nothing is ever Morning: by the time `t` clears 10:00 it
       has already passed the 08:00 test, so the day runs
       Night -> Day -> Evening -> Night.
    2. The phase that follows an unreachable one starts at the LATER
       boundary, not its own. In that same example Day starts at 10:00
       (Morning's boundary), not at its own 08:00.

    Both fall out of one rule: each phase effectively begins at the
    running maximum of the boundaries up to and including its own, and
    occupies the span up to the next phase's effective start - so it is
    real exactly when that span is non-empty.

    Returned as [(name, start_ts), ...] in order, omitting any phase
    that never happens. Night is a special case in both directions: the
    day always *opens* on Night (`t < morning_ts`), so its own boundary
    marks the RETURN to Night rather than its only appearance - and if
    nothing ever leaves Night (every other phase unreachable, as with a
    fully reversed schedule) there is no return to mark, so nothing is
    returned at all. A mark means "the phase changes here"; a day that is
    Night throughout changes nowhere.

    This exists because the boundaries are freely settable `time`
    entities, so an out-of-order schedule is a state a user can reach.
    The curve itself already handles it correctly, having gone through
    phase_at(); it's anything drawing the boundaries *directly* from the
    four timestamps - the dashboard card's phase labels and lines - that
    would otherwise show a phase that isn't happening, at a time it

    The transition sits *before* the boundary, so the value arrives at
    the next phase's exactly as that phase begins - "if Morning is at
    6am, it IS the morning setting at 6am". A duration of 0 is therefore
    a hard cut, which is the point: some boundaries should be visible.

    The duration is clamped to the phase it runs in, so a value too long
    to fit simply means "the whole phase" rather than bleeding backwards
    into the phase before. Clamping happens here rather than by rewriting
    the config: phase lengths move daily (Evening tracks sunset), so a
    duration that fits in summer and not in winter has to keep working.

    The interpolation factor is clamped as well, and that is load-bearing
    for a different reason - day_phase is a *parameter*, not derived from
    now_ts. coordinator.py passes a manually-overridden phase alongside
    the real clock, so a phase can legitimately be asked for at an
    instant outside its own span. Unclamped, the ramp would extrapolate
    straight past the target and keep going.

    Past the phase's own span entirely - strictly past `span_end`, not
    merely reaching it - this returns `own` outright, rather than the
    fully-ramped next-phase value the clamp above would otherwise settle
    on. `now_ts == span_end` exactly still ramps all the way to t=1
    (the next phase's value): that instant is the boundary itself, where
    "the value arrives at the next phase's exactly as that phase begins"
    (see above) is meant to hold regardless of which phase asked for it.
    Confirmed live as a real bug: overriding the phase-override select to
    "Night" during actual evening real time - hours past Night's own
    span, not merely at its edge - showed Morning's brightness/colour
    (255/7000K) instead of Night's own (80/2700K), because the
    interpolation factor clamped to 1 - which is
    `values[_NEXT_PHASE["Night"]]`, Morning's value, not Night's own.
    This can only change behaviour for an overridden phase: phase_at()'s
    own natural output never lets now_ts get past a phase's own span_end
    for that same phase - the instant it does, phase_at() has already
    returned the *next* phase instead - so the full-day curve-preview
    computation (coordinator.py's _compute_curve_points, which always
    derives day_phase fresh via phase_at(t, ...) for that same t) is
    unaffected."""
