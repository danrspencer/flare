"""
Shared schedule coordinator for the optional day-phase/curve sensors
(sensor.py), the phase-override select (select.py), and the schedule/
curve config entities (number.py, time.py, switch.py) - all share one
coordinator instance per schedule instance (see ScheduleInstance
below), created once in __init__.py and stashed in hass.data, rather
than each computing independently.

Boundary computation mirrors what used to be the live
packages/adaptive_lighting.yaml Jinja setup: morning/day/night are
today's configured time-of-day; evening is sunset (sun.sun's
next_setting), clamped between earliest/latest bounds. The five times,
and the eight brightness/Kelvin curve values, are read live off this
instance's own time.*/number.* entities (see time.py/number.py) rather
than from static config-entry data - the config_flow.py "Add Sensor"
form only ever asks for a name; every other value is a real HA entity,
adjustable at any time, with its own default and its own persisted
state (RestoreEntity/RestoreNumber). This is the same "check live
state fresh, don't read a frozen snapshot" pattern _phase_override()
below already used for the phase-override select - now applied
uniformly to the rest of the schedule/curve config too.

Override: each instance's own select.<prefix>flare_phase
can pin the phase used for "right now" - _phase_override() reads its
*current* live state on every update, the same "check fresh, don't
remember" style grouping.py's externally_set() uses, so there's nothing
to expire or persist here beyond what the select entity itself already
does (see select.py's RestoreEntity use). curve.py's phase-taking
functions don't care where the phase string came from, so overriding
needed no changes there.

Deliberately asymmetric: the override affects the "right now" phase/
brightness/kelvin, but NOT the precomputed curve (`points`) - the curve
is a full-day schedule/forecast, and pinning "right now" to Evening
doesn't mean the schedule would have looked different at 9am. This was
previously an accidental inconsistency in the live Jinja version
(noted in phase_at()'s docstring); here it's the same behaviour but
deliberate.

Schedule instances: the config entry itself never carries a schedule -
it registers no services of its own (they belong to the Tracking
entry, see services/handlers.py), and no sensor is auto-created. Every schedule is a "sensor" subentry, added via the
"Add Sensor" flow (config_flow.py's SensorSubentryFlow) - so there's
exactly one mechanism for adding a schedule, and exactly one way to
name it: what you type there. Every instance gets both a prefixed
entity_id (sensor.living_room_flare) and its own device
(Settings -> Devices, renamable there - see
ScheduleInstance.device_info). schedule_instances() is the one place
that enumerates all of them -
__init__.py, sensor.py, select.py, number.py, time.py, and switch.py
all iterate its output rather than each re-deriving the subentry
lookup.
