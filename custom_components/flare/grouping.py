"""
Turns "these entities, this target brightness/colour-temperature" into
the minimal set of light.turn_on/turn_off calls actually needed.

Pure logic - HA access (current state, attributes, device/label
lookups) is injected via an EntityLookup so this is testable with
plain pytest and fakes, and so the integration's __init__.py
(custom_components/flare/__init__.py) stays a thin
adapter registering this as a standalone HA service. Transitively
imports homeassistant.util.color (via override_protection.py's own
_color_temp_matches, used below in _already_set) - see that module's
own docstring for why that's a deliberate exception rather than an
oversight.

This is a direct port of what used to be the blueprint's repeat-loop
`variables:` block (powerable_entities / multiplier_groups /
group_needing_off / group_needing_update / group_two_step /
group_combined) - same behaviour, same defaults, just Python instead of
namespace-loop Jinja.

    min_color_temp_kelvin/max_color_temp_kelvin.

    This is the colour-temperature counterpart of MAX_BRIGHTNESS above,
    and exists for exactly the same reason - except that where
    light.turn_on clamps brightness itself (vol.Clamp), it does *not*
    clamp colour temperature for a light that natively supports
    COLOR_TEMP: the value is passed straight through to the integration
    and the physical device clamps it. Confirmed against HA core's
    light/__init__.py, which only rewrites color_temp_kelvin when the
    light *lacks* COLOR_TEMP support (emulating it via RGBWW/HS).

    So the write is harmless - the bulb goes to its ceiling - but
    _already_set would then compare that ceiling against the un-clamped
    target, never find it within tolerance, and re-command the light on
    every single tick forever. Confirmed live: light.dining_room_1 and
    light.kitchen_1 report max_color_temp_kelvin 6535 against a 6667K
    Morning target (132K apart, and not mired-equivalent either -
    floor(1e6/6535)=153 vs floor(1e6/6667)=149), and the six
    light.extension_* bulbs cap at 4000K while Day ramps 6667->4000.

    Deliberately clamps only what we *compare* against, not what gets
    sent: entities are dispatched in shared per-multiplier groups, and
    two bulbs in one group can have different ceilings, so clamping the
    outgoing value would mean splitting a group per distinct ceiling for
    no benefit - the device already does this clamping itself. A missing
    or unparseable bound (0 below - no real bulb reports 0K) leaves the
    target untouched, so a light that doesn't publish its range behaves
    exactly as it did before.

    The advertised range is NOT always authoritative, which is why
    _already_set treats this as an *additional* way to match rather than
    a replacement: confirmed live, light.utility_spot_1 advertises
    max_color_temp_kelvin 4000 while happily reporting 5813 and tracking
    the curve correctly. Comparing such a bulb only against its clamped
    target would re-command it on every tick - the exact bug this
