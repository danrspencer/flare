"""Config flow for FLARE.

Adding the integration once creates both entries - Schedules and
Tracking (async_step_user explains why it is still two entries, and
why only one of them is created visibly). Neither asks for anything
beyond which rooms to track. No sensor is auto-created; every
day-phase/curve sensor + phase-override select is a "sensor" subentry
(SensorSubentryFlow below), added explicitly from the Schedules entry's
own page (Add Sensor) - one mechanism for every sensor, you name it
yourself from the start.

Deliberately does NOT auto-seed a first sensor the way earlier versions
did (used to be hardcoded to the name "Default", regardless of what a
user typed anywhere, since there was nowhere to type a name at all for
it). Two real problems with that, not just a naming quibble: (1) HA's
own "integration added" dialog shows an unconditional rename+area-picker
form whenever a config flow creates a device - not something an
integration can suppress - so adding this integration always popped up
that form for a device the user hadn't asked to create yet. (2)
Renaming that device later only ever changes its *displayed* name
(HA's own entity-id auto-rename only happens once, in that first-run
dialog, never again) - so the "Default" entity_id prefix was permanent
regardless of what the device got renamed to, which is exactly the
confusion this change avoids by never creating anything unnamed in the
first place.

A subentry only ever asks for one thing: a name. It becomes both the
sensor's device name (Settings -> Devices, renamable later) and its
entity_id prefix (sensor.living_room_flare etc) - see
coordinator.py's ScheduleInstance/schedule_instances(). Everything else
- the five schedule times and the eight brightness/Kelvin curve values
- is a real HA entity on that device instead of a config-flow field
(time.py/number.py), each starting at a sensible default
(curve.DEFAULT_SCHEDULE_HOURS/DEFAULT_CURVE_VALUES) and adjustable at
any time with no reconfigure flow needed - direct, discoverable, and
automatable, rather than hidden behind a form only reachable via
Configure.

        They stay two entries, not one: schedules and tracking are
        different kinds of thing, and an entry is the only level at
        which that distinction can be drawn - HA's integration page
        renders one section per subentry with no way to group them by
        type, so a single entry flattens schedule sensors and state
        devices into one long list of siblings. Nothing in that
        argument asked anyone to walk through Add Integration twice to
        get there, though, so this step asks the one thing there is to
        ask - which rooms to track - and creates both.

        Each half is still creatable on its own, so deleting one and
        adding it back works rather than aborting on the other's
        account.

        because Schedules creates no devices. HA's "integration added"

        picker for every device belonging to the completing flow's
        entry, and an integration has no way to suppress it - while
        Tracking seeds a state device per room, which is exactly the
        pile of rename prompts for things nobody named that the dialog
