"""
Decides, for a given entity, whether a write should be allowed through
or blocked because something else has touched the entity since - the
"override protection" mechanism. Which state device an entity's claims
belong to (its "scope") is decided by the caller, one layer up in
write_tracking.py; this module only classifies the claims it's handed,
with no notion of scope or caller identity of its own. Pure logic - no
`hass` instance needed, same
pattern as curve.py/scenes.py/grouping.py: HA access (live state,
Store-backed persistence, the unavailable/recovery listener) stays in
write_tracking.py, which is the thing that actually calls this module.
Does import `homeassistant.util.color` directly (for the Kelvin/mired
rounding `_color_temp_matches` needs) - a deliberate exception to
"zero `homeassistant.*` imports", not an oversight: that import is
cheap (no core/event-loop machinery), it's the actual function HA
itself uses (no risk of drifting from real device behaviour), and the
"these tests run without HA installed" property this was nominally
protecting doesn't hold in practice anyway - pytest's own `testpaths`
config already pulls in `tests/integration/conftest.py`, which
requires `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`, regardless of which
test file is targeted.

Genuinely generic, not specific to adaptive lighting or even to
lights - the only light-flavoured piece is `target_matches_values`'s
{brightness, color_temp_kelvin, rgb_color} shape, deliberately kept
concrete rather than generalised to arbitrary entity attributes.

Three consumers share this one decision table: grouping.py's
`EntityLookup.externally_set()`, sensor.py's diagnostic status, and the
standalone `claims_check` service. Keeping them on one implementation
is the point - they previously drifted, and an off light was classified
"overridden" in one and "not excluded" in the other.

Each tracked entity carries two claims - `observed` and `latest`.

`observed` is a state we have seen and know is safe to write over. It
gets there several ways, only one of which is a write of our own: a
write an earlier call saw the bulb adopt, the pre-write baseline for an
entity's first-ever write, the snapshot taken at startup, or the one
taken when a device comes back from unavailable. What unites them is
not authorship but confidence - nothing unexplained has happened to the
light since.

`latest` is the most recent write we sent, not yet independently
re-observed. See
write_tracking.py's own module docstring for the full reasoning behind
the two-claim design, the first-write baseline, and the 5-second
Entity._context-expiry rescue `target_matches_values` exists for -
that reasoning lives there rather than being duplicated here, since
write_tracking.py is what actually persists these claims; this module
only classifies them.

    advertised colour-temp range, passed straight through to
    target_matches_values() - see its own docstring. Optional, default
    None (unknown range, old behaviour).

    - `"off"` - not on. Override protection is moot; checked first,
      before any claim.
    - `"untracked"` - no claim at all, or only a single unverified
      `latest` attempt that doesn't match live state. Not enough
      evidence to call it external, so free to manage. Also what a
      light deliberately handed off to a scene or a hands-off
      multiplier reads as, once the blueprint releases it. This is the
      one gap the two-claim design doesn't close: a light's very first
      tracked write, if that's the one that drops, is indistinguishable
      from a genuine external change until an `observed` baseline
      exists.
    - `"controlled"` - we are in control. Either the live context
      matches a claim, or it matches neither but the current value
      still matches what a claim asked for (`latest` checked first,
      then `observed`). Deliberately one status rather than two: from
      any caller's point of view these are the same situation, and
      `is_blocked()` has always treated them identically. Which claim
      matched, and how, is reported separately in `matched_via` - that
      is diagnostic detail, not a different outcome.

      Two separate reasons a context alone can't be trusted, one per
      claim: `latest`, because Entity._context expires 5s after the
      call that set it, so a slow device confirms under an unrelated
      context while echoing exactly what was asked; `observed`, because
      a light that never adopted the latest write is by definition
      still showing what the last landed write asked for. Without both,
      such a light reads as external and - since nothing un-marks it
      while it stays on - is excluded from every future write the
      instant it next needs a different value.
    - `"overridden"` - an `observed` claim exists and neither claim
      matches, by context or by value.

    Context matching covers *either* of a claim's two context ids; most
    claims have one, a two-step transition's has two.

    `matched_via` names which claim matched and how -
    `"latest-context"`, `"latest-value"`, `"observed-context"` or
    `"observed-value"` - and is `None` for every other status. Purely
    diagnostic (the write-tracking sensor and card), never used for
    decisions here or in `is_blocked()`. This is where the detail that
    used to be split across two statuses now lives: `latest-*` means the
