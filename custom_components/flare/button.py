"""
A per-scope "Clear" button - discards a state device's tracked claims so
its lights are free to be taken again.

Clearing is the documented escape hatch for a light stuck "overridden"
(see write_tracking.py's async_clear docstring for how that happens with
no external cause). It lived only inside a custom dashboard card until
this existed, which meant the one action you might need in a hurry was
the one thing you couldn't put on an ordinary dashboard, into a script,
or behind a physical button.

button rather than switch: a stateless "do it now" action with nothing
to turn back off is exactly what ButtonEntity is for. It also means the
entity's state is the last-pressed timestamp, so "when did I last reset
this room" ends up in history for free.

    are stuck - and being stuck in a way classify() doesn't recognise is

    their claims too, so each is unprotected until its next write, which
