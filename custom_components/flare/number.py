"""
Brightness/Kelvin curve config, as live number entities - one per
coordinator.py's CURVE_KEYS, per schedule instance. Left at their
default (curve.py's DEFAULT_CURVE_VALUES) on first creation; changing
one persists (RestoreNumber) and immediately refreshes that instance's
coordinator (see async_set_native_value below) rather than waiting up
to 60s for the next poll.

entity_category=CONFIG groups these under the device's "Configuration"
section in the UI, separate from the primary sensor/curve/phase-select
entities - eight extra always-visible entities per sensor just to
occasionally tweak one number would be exactly the kind of noise the
old boundary sensors were criticised for; CONFIG keeps them present
(and dashboard/automation-usable) without cluttering the main view.
