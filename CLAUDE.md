# CLAUDE.md

Context for resuming work on this repo in a fresh session. See README.md
for the user-facing description; this file is about *how* to work on it
and *why* it's shaped the way it is. This file documents current
architecture and decisions, not a session-by-session change log - the
git history is the changelog; a fact only belongs here once it's stayed
true.

## Where this came from

This started as a single Home Assistant blueprint - still live, at
`blueprints/automation/danspencer/adaptive_lighting_unified.yaml` on
the actual HA instance - that grew ~150 lines of namespace-loop Jinja
for target resolution, reachability filtering, multiplier bucketing,
tolerance-based "already correct" checks, and manufacturer-based
two-step transition detection. It worked, but became unreadable and
hard to change safely. This repo is the migration of the genuinely
computational parts (not triggers/conditions) out of Jinja, while
keeping the blueprint native for the parts HA already does well.

That migration went through two different backends. The first attempt
moved the computation into pyscript - working, unit-tested Python, but
getting it to actually *load* inside pyscript cost an entire session
chasing dormant bugs that all looked identical from the outside
("nothing happens, no error") - see lesson 8 below. That experience is
why the computation now lives in
`custom_components/flare/` instead - a real Home
Assistant integration that registers its own services directly, with no
pyscript dependency and none of that machinery to go wrong. **pyscript
is entirely gone from this repo now** - lesson 8 is kept only in case
pyscript comes up again in some other project.

**This repo is now two pieces, and the dependency between them runs one
way** (see "The architectural split" below): the
`flare` HACS integration (curve math + grouping
logic, exposed as plain HA services anyone can call from their own
automation) and the `flare` blueprint
(triggers/conditions/target-resolution, built on top of those services).

Be precise about that asymmetry, because it is easy to describe wrongly
and the docs did for a while. The **integration** stands alone: the
services are documented and useful from any automation, and should be
written that way, not as if the blueprint is their only consumer. The
**blueprint** does not stand alone - it depends on the services
entirely and does nothing without them. What it is is a worked example:
an off-the-shelf automation wiring the services up the way most rooms
want them, which anyone can take, change, or rip apart to build
something different on the same services. "Loosely coupled" is the
wrong phrase for it, and "independently useful" is simply untrue of the
blueprint half.

This repo's blueprint is named `flare.yaml` (blueprint name "FLARE").
It was previously `adaptive_lighting.yaml`, deliberately not
`adaptive_lighting_unified`
- different file, different in-UI name, so it can be installed and
tested alongside the live `adaptive_lighting_unified.yaml` without
touching it, and rooms migrated over individually. Linking the two
blueprints to the same filename is exactly what caused the incident
in lesson 6 below - don't reintroduce that collision.

**Documentation layout: README.md, and then the site.** README.md is
the only Markdown left at the repo root, and it is the pitch - why this
project exists, why the day is divided into four named phases
(Morning/Day/Evening/Night) rather than a single continuous
sun-elevation curve the way most adaptive-lighting tools work - plus
links onward. Everything else lives in `docs/` and is published to
<https://danrspencer.github.io/flare/>: `installation.md` (quickstart),
the `playground.html` interactive curve, `dashboard.md` (how to add the
view strategy), `blueprint.md` (full per-feature/input breakdown),
and a `docs/advanced/` "Power users" section (`has_children: true`):
`reference.md` (the full service/entity reference - this is what
`helpers.md` was renamed to when the docs site was restructured, see
below), `scenes.md` (scene handoff), and
`custom-automations.md` (building without the blueprint). Contributing
lives at the repo root as `CONTRIBUTING.md` (repo layout, tests, how to
build the site) - it is for people working on the code, who are already
on GitHub, so it is not a site page.

**The rules for writing docs, and the lexicon of terms, live in
`DOCUMENTATION.md`** - one home, so a style guide doesn't end up in
three places disagreeing. Read it before touching `docs/`. What belongs
here rather than there is the *history*: this has gone wrong three
times. `docs/dashboard.html` once grew to ~145 lines explaining
`--feature-color`, `cardFeatureStyles`, `ha-control-slider` internals,
`column_span` arithmetic and why card-mod was rejected. The homepage
carried the same class of thing. Most recently `docs/blueprint.md` had
grown to 300 lines of design rationale with its actual reference table
last, and naming an input ("Room") that does not exist in the UI. The
pattern each time is the same: a decision felt worth writing down, and
it went onto a site page instead of into a code comment or this file.

These pages are **site pages, not files meant to be read on GitHub** -
that distinction is load-bearing. An earlier arrangement kept
`docs/blueprint.md`/`docs/helpers.md` pristine for GitHub readers and
generated front-matter'd copies at build time, because GitHub renders a
front matter block as a metadata table. Once they became site-only, the
front matter went straight into the files and the whole generation step
(`docs/_build/prepare.py`, plus its link rewriting) was deleted. Don't
reintroduce it without reintroducing the reason.

The Morning-phase research citation
([He et al., 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36058557/), J Sleep
Res - twelve college students, 1.5h of morning light at 1000 lux/6500 K
vs regular office light at 300 lux/4000 K for one working week, sleep
efficiency 83.8% vs 80.4%) was verified via a live web search before
being added, not recalled from memory - worth re-verifying rather than
trusting as-is if it's ever revised, same standard any factual claim in
these docs should meet.

**It has already been described wrongly once**, which is why the numbers
are spelled out here: README.md and docs/index.md both called the
participants "office workers" (they were students who worked in a
university office) and omitted that n=12. Cite it as the small study it
is. Note also that its bright condition is **6500 K** - so FLARE's
DEFAULT_MORNING_KELVIN of 6667 already sits at the researched figure,
and there is no evidence here for going cooler than that.

## The architectural split (deliberate, not arbitrary)

**Stays in the blueprint (Jinja/YAML):**
- All triggers, conditions, target resolution (`resolved_entities`),
  occupancy detection (`occupied`, plus the native `occupancy.*`
  trigger/condition path - see "Current status" below), and the action
  *structure* (which service to call, on what target).
- Scene compatibility checking (`scene_active`/`scene_valid`) is a
  partial exception - the *logic* also exists as a standalone service
  (`compute_scene_coverage`), but the blueprint's own inline Jinja
  version is deliberately left in place rather than rewired to call it.
  Reason: it's read by a `condition:` block (see lesson 4 - conditions
  can't call services at all), and moving it server-side would mean
  losing that `condition:`-level suppression (the tick would still fire
  and call `apply_lighting`/`scene.turn_on` every time as an idempotent
  no-op instead of not running at all - functionally harmless, not
  behaviourally identical). See "Parked: scene handling in
  apply_lighting" below for the full design if this gets picked back up.
- Override protection lives in `grouping.py`/`override_protection.py`,
  not in a trigger. A one-shot trigger-level check can't provide a
  standing invariant (lesson 5); the real check re-evaluates against
  live state on every call. See "Override protection" under Current
  status.
- **The blueprint knows phase names in three places** - `rgb_phases`,
  the four per-phase scene pickers, and the four per-phase exclude
  lists. A deliberate exception to "the blueprint doesn't know phase
  names", chosen explicitly because editing a Jinja template in the HA
  UI is poor ergonomics for something this simple. Precedence in both
  templated cases: the *template* wins, the per-phase picker is the
  fallback for what it doesn't cover.
- Why any of this stays in Jinja at all: HA `condition:` blocks cannot
  call a service - only `action:` steps can - so anything
  condition:-gating must stay template-based. These pieces are also
  compact and get real value from HA's native trace UI
  (`ha_get_automation_traces`), used heavily to diagnose issues live.

Blueprint input mechanics worth knowing:

- Inputs are grouped with `sections:` (HA 2024.6.0+). Nesting an input
  in a section does **not** change its name for `!input` purposes.
- The blueprint declares `homeassistant.min_version: 2026.4.0` - what
  the `occupancy.*` triggers require, not `sections`' lower floor.
- `adaptive_sensor` uses `entity: filter: [{integration: ..., domain:
  sensor}]` - the `filter:` list is the only documented shape combining
  `integration:` with `domain:`; don't mix a bare top-level `domain:`
  with a sibling `filter:` (same class of trap as lesson 14). Accepted
  trade-off: this hides a hand-rolled "bring your own sensor" entity
  from the picker, so `docs/blueprint.md` documents pointing at one via
  "Edit in YAML".
- **Input renames are breaking.** A stored input simply stops matching
  any input the blueprint declares, so every already-migrated room
  automation needs the old key removed outright, not left blank, as
  part of deploying a rename.

**Lives in `custom_components/flare/` (a standalone
HACS integration - see Current status for the services):**
- Reachability filtering, multiplier bucketing, the tolerance-based
  "already at target" check, override protection, and
  two-step-vs-combined / RGB-vs-colour-temp label routing
  (`grouping.py`). This was the genuinely gnarly part - nested namespace
  loops, nothing pytest-testable in Jinja, and a real correctness gap
  (exact-match comparisons that silently stopped skipping for any bulb
  with device-side rounding quirks).
- Day-phase brightness/Kelvin curve math (`curve.py`) - not because it
  was complicated, but because it's a small, reusable, independently
  useful piece of logic that belongs as a documented service.
- Scene-coverage gap filling (`scenes.py`) - explicitly generic;
  nothing about it is specific to lighting.

All services are deliberately written and documented as standalone
tools, useful to anyone building their own automation, not just to the
blueprint in this repo. Keep them that way.

## Hard-won lessons (don't repeat these)

1. **Jinja macros can only return rendered text, never a native Python
   list.** `{% macro x() %}{{ some_list }}{% endmacro %}` returns a
   *string* that looks like a list. If a macro needs to hand back a
   real list to be used *within the same template*, round-trip through
   `to_json`/`from_json`. This is why an earlier attempt at a shared
   `custom_templates/*.jinja` macro for target resolution was abandoned
   in favour of duplicating that logic inline in the blueprint - not
   worth re-attempting without a strong reason.

2. **`custom_templates/*.jinja` files are scanned once at HA startup,
   not on a config/automation reload.** Adding a *new* file there and
   then reloading core config will NOT pick it up — it needs a full HA
   restart. This broke every automation sharing the blueprint in
   production for about a minute before being caught and reverted.

3. **Symlinks for deployment must be created on the HA host itself, not
   through a Samba/SMB mount from another machine.** A symlink's target
   is just a string; if it's written from macOS via a mounted share,
   the target needs to be a path meaningful to *Home Assistant's own
   filesystem* (e.g. `/config/...`), not the mounting machine's path.
   Simplest correct approach: clone this repo directly on the HA host
   and symlink from there.

4. **HA `condition:` blocks cannot call services.** This is *the*
   constraint that shaped the architectural split above — any value a
   `condition:` needs must be computed via template (or a native
   condition type - see the `occupancy.is_detected` note in "Current
   status"), not via a service call.

5. **A trigger firing once does not mean protection persists.** A
   one-shot trigger-level check (the blueprint's old `manual` trigger,
   context.user_id-based, since removed entirely - see the
   architectural-split note above) is not the same as a standing
   invariant later code respects - it only blocked the one automation
   run where it fired, not a later independent `adaptive` tick. Fixed
   properly in `grouping.py`'s `EntityLookup` (originally
   `manually_set()`, later renamed `externally_set()` when the
   underlying check moved from `context.user_id` to `context.id`
   equality - see "Current status"): instead of remembering that an
   override happened, it re-checks the entity's *current* state on
   every call - room-empty, light-off, and device-recovery release
   conditions all fall out for free from that. The one piece that
   *does* now need persisted state, contrary to this lesson's original
   framing, is knowing what to compare the current state against -
   `write_tracking.py`'s in-memory record of what context.id this
   integration itself last wrote each entity with. The lesson still
   holds where it always mattered: a trigger's one-shot firing is not a
   substitute for a check performed fresh on every tick.

6. **A same-named blueprint can take out every room at once.** This
   repo's blueprint used to share a filename with the live, already-
   deployed `adaptive_lighting_unified.yaml`, which 15 room automations
   referenced by that exact path - symlinking a materially different
   blueprint over it broke every one of them at once. Fixed at the root
   by giving this repo's blueprint a different file name *and* a
   different in-blueprint `name:`, so the two install side by side with
   zero interaction. Related: when a Samba-mounted view of `/config`
   disagrees with itself during recovery (a file `ls` won't show but
   which still blocks writes - consistent with a symlink Samba isn't
   surfacing but is still enforcing), stop trying to fix it through that
   mount and go to the host directly.

7. **A symlink's target is only meaningful from the shell session that
   created it.** A working symlink (right path, right name) can still
   fail every read with an opaque error indistinguishable from a
   permissions/sandboxing problem - `dirname "$0"` + `pwd` inside a
   deploy script bakes in whatever path *that* shell session happens to
   see (e.g. `/root/config/...` from an SSH-session alias), which is
   meaningless to a different process reading the same symlink back
   later, even on "the same host". `scripts/link_into_ha.sh` copies the
   blueprint and pyscript-era files instead of symlinking them (see its
   `copy()` function) specifically to sidestep this, not because
   symlinks are fundamentally broken. The dashboard card is still
   symlinked; if it ever shows the same failure mode, this is why.

8. **pyscript-specific loading gotchas (pyscript is no longer part of
   this repo - kept only in case pyscript resurfaces elsewhere):** a
   folder-based app only autoloads from a file named exactly
   `__init__.py` (any other filename is silently skipped, no error at
   any log level); an app can't share its name with a module package it
   imports from (identical names send pyscript's import resolution into
   infinite recursion until Python's recursion limit raises
   `RecursionError`, not a normal import error); and a pyscript app
   needs an explicit entry (even empty) under `pyscript: apps:` in YAML
   config, or it's silently skipped at debug-log level only, invisible
   at the default WARNING level. All three present identically from the
   outside: "nothing happens, no error."

9. **A stray `.bak-<timestamp>` directory under `custom_components/`
   isn't inert - it can break the domain it's a backup of.** Home
   Assistant discovers custom integrations by scanning every directory
   under `custom_components/` for a `manifest.json` and reading its
   `domain` key, not by the directory's own name - a leftover backup
   directory with the same `domain:` in its manifest broke config-flow
   resolution with a bare, unhelpful `404 Invalid handler specified`
   until the stray directory was found (only via grepping
   `home-assistant.log` for the domain name) and removed, and even then
   the fix needed a *second* full restart to take effect - HA's
   flow-handler registry is built once at startup, so un-discovering a
   directory needs the same "restart to rescan" treatment as
   discovering a new one. Clean up `link_into_ha.sh`'s `.bak-*` backups
   promptly, especially under `custom_components/`.

10. **A wrong-but-similarly-shaped constructor argument or a missing
    `@callback` decorator can sit dormant through months of "working"
    code, because unit tests never exercise the real HA event loop.**
    Two real instances in this integration: `DataUpdateCoordinator.__init__`
    was passed `__name__` (a plain string) where a `logging.Logger` was
    expected - fine until the coordinator's own refresh cycle actually
    called `self.logger.isEnabledFor(...)`, which only happened once a
    real schedule instance existed to refresh. Separately, a state-change
    listener called `hass.async_create_task()` without `@callback` -
    fine until it was registered against live entities and actually
    invoked, then raised a thread-safety `RuntimeError` (a plain `def`
    with no `@callback` marker runs in the worker thread pool, where
    `async_create_task` isn't safe to call - confirm via
    `homeassistant/core.py`'s `get_hassjob_callable_job_type` before
    trusting a fix here). Neither could have been caught without a live
    HA event loop actually exercising the code path.

11. **`sun.sun`'s `next_setting` attribute is exactly that - *next* -
    not "today's sunset."** The moment today's sunset passes,
    `next_setting` points at tomorrow's, roughly 24h ahead. Comparing a
    boundary directly against it (`max(earliest, min(next_setting,
    latest))`) silently clamps to the *latest* bound the instant sunset
    passes, instead of holding today's actual sunset time - `curve.py`'s
    boundary computation projects the sunset's local time-of-day onto
    today instead of using the absolute timestamp directly.

12. **A branch-name `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL can serve a stale,
    cached copy for a few minutes after a push, even when the fetching
    tool reports success.** Re-importing a blueprint immediately after
    pushing can silently install the *previous* commit's content -
    `ha_import_blueprint`'s own "re-imported successfully" response is
    not proof of freshness; confirm with `ha_read_file` against what
    actually landed. A commit-SHA-pinned raw URL
    (`.../blob/<full-sha>/...`) is immune to this, since GitHub treats
    that URL as immutable and never serves it stale - use one when
    testing a just-pushed change against a live instance.

13. **`ha_import_blueprint` derives the installed path from the GitHub
    repo *owner* in the URL, not from this repo's own blueprint folder
    name.** This repo's blueprint lives at
    `blueprints/automation/danspencer/flare.yaml` (no 'r'),
    but the actual GitHub account is `danrspencer` (with an 'r') - a
    mismatch that predates this file. Importing from this repo's GitHub
    URL installs to `danrspencer/adaptive_lighting.yaml` on the live
    instance, a *different* path from the `danspencer/...` one already
    in use, rather than overwriting it - `overrides_existing: false` in
    the response is the tell. The same "danspencer" vs "danrspencer"
    collision lesson 6 warns about, surfacing here through a tool's own
    path-derivation logic instead of a symlink. `blueprints/` is
    read-only through every available file-editing tool, so there's no
    way to fix the orphaned old path directly - repoint the automation's
    `use_blueprint.path` at the new, correctly-updated file instead, and
    leave the old one as a harmless (not domain-scanned, unlike lesson
    9's `.bak-*` incident) orphaned leftover.

14. **A `target:` selector's `entity:` sub-key has a different schema
    from the plain (non-target) `entity:` selector - the multi-filter
    list goes directly under `entity:`, with no nested `filter:` key.**
    `selector: entity: filter: [...]` is correct for a standalone entity
    selector (`EntitySelectorConfig.filter`), but the identical shape
    under a `target:` selector (`selector: target: entity: filter: [...]`)
    fails blueprint import outright with `extra keys not allowed` -
    `TargetSelectorConfig.entity` (`homeassistant/helpers/selector.py`)
    *is* the list of filters itself:
    `selector: target: entity: [{domain: light}, {domain: binary_sensor,
    device_class: occupancy}]`. Confirmed against HA core source before
    fixing, not guessed from the error text alone - caught immediately
    by a live blueprint import failing, not by any local validation
    (plain `yaml.safe_load` has no opinion on selector schemas).

15. **In a `sections`-view dashboard, a card doesn't inherit its
    section's full width just because the section itself is
    full-width.** Each section is its own 12-column grid, and only
    some card types claim all 12 by default (`heading` cards do); a
    nested `type: grid` card and a custom card without a
    `getLayoutOptions()` implementation don't, and render at whatever
    their own natural size is - about a third of the section, in
    practice - even with `column_span` correctly maxed out on the
    section around them. Caught live: `column_span: 4` on both floor
    sections measured correctly via `getBoundingClientRect()` (1120px
    of 1184px available), yet the curve card and every nested tile
    grid inside them measured only 368px - the section was genuinely
    full-width, its content just wasn't using it. Fixed with
    `grid_options: {columns: full}` on each of those cards
    individually (not on the section) - confirmed via the same
    `getBoundingClientRect()` check, now 1120px across the board. This
    is a general `sections`-view behavior, not anything specific to
    this project's custom card - documented in
    `home-assistant-best-practices`'s dashboard-guide.md under "Card
    Sizing and Responsive Layout" once found, but not something a
    plain `column_span` fix on the section makes you suspect exists.

16. **A blueprint input with no `default:` is required, regardless of
    "(Optional)" in its own `name:`.** Adding four new entity-selector
    inputs (`morning_scene`/`day_scene`/`evening_scene`/`night_scene`)
    without a `default:` key broke every one of the 15 dependent room
    automations on the very next re-import - none of them set these new
    inputs (they're meant to be optional), so HA's blueprint
    substitution failed to generate any of them at all:
    `Failed to generate automation from blueprint: Missing input
    day_scene, evening_scene, morning_scene, night_scene`, confirmed via
    the live error log (`ha_get_logs(source="error_log")`), not just
    suspected. `ha_get_overview`'s `repair_count` going from 0 to 15 in
    one step was the first signal - all 15 `validation_failed_blueprint`
    repairs, all created within the same second. Every other optional
    input in this blueprint already had an explicit default (`""`,
    `"{{ {} }}"`, `[]`) - these four were the only ones missing it,
    added in the same change as several that did have one, which is
    presumably why it wasn't caught in review. Fixed with `default: null`
    on each; the downstream Jinja already treated an unset value
    correctly (falsy, falls through to a fallback branch) - only the
    blueprint schema itself was wrong. Restored live service by
    importing directly from the fix branch's own commit SHA rather than
    waiting for a PR merge - a pushed commit is immediately fetchable by
    SHA regardless of merge state, and this is a case where minimizing
    outage time mattered more than the normal branch-then-PR-then-merge
    sequencing.

## Current status

Everything below describes how the system works *now*. Per-change
history lives in git; this file only carries what stays true, plus the
decisions and constraints that aren't recoverable from the code.

### Services (`custom_components/flare/__init__.py`)

Seven, all unit tested and confirmed working live. Full field contracts
in `docs/helpers.md` and `services.yaml` - not repeated here.

- `compute_lighting_groups` / `compute_curve` / `compute_scene_coverage`
  - pure planners, no side effects.
- `apply_lighting` - the only side-effecting one; wraps the same
  grouping logic and issues `light.turn_on`/`turn_off`. Takes
  `brightness`/`color_temp_kelvin`/`rgb_color` as **plain values**, not
  a sensor entity_id. It read a sensor internally once; that was
  reverted deliberately, and the reversal is meant to stick - entity
  *selection* happens via the blueprint's `adaptive_sensor` regardless
  of which layer reads the attributes, and voluptuous's own required-
  field validation gives the same hard failure the internal read was
  added for.
- `claims_check` / `claims_record` / `claims_clear` - override
  protection exposed standalone, for callers that want it without any
  curve/brightness logic. `claims_clear` is the manual escape hatch
  for a light stuck `overridden`.

`rgb_color` on both `apply_lighting` and `compute_lighting_groups`
accepts an explicit `None`, not just an omitted key (`vol.Any(None,
...)`): the blueprint templates it unconditionally from a sensor
attribute that a hand-rolled "bring your own sensor" entity is free not
to publish, so it renders a literal null.

### Override protection

Each tracked entity carries two claims - `confirmed` (a write an earlier
call observed landing) and `pending` (the most recent attempt). The full
model, and why two rather than one, lives in `write_tracking.py`'s module
docstring; the decision table lives in `override_protection.classify()`;
the user-facing contract lives in `docs/helpers.md`. Three consumers
share that one table - `grouping.py`'s `externally_set()`, `sensor.py`'s
diagnostic status, and `claims_check` - deliberately, because they
previously drifted.

Facts worth knowing before touching it, each verified against HA core
rather than assumed:

- `context.id`, not `context.user_id`: every service call in one
  automation run shares that run's context (`helpers/script.py`), so
  user_id can't tell our write from another automation's.
- `Entity._context` expires 5 seconds after the service call that set it
  (`core.py`), so a device whose confirmation takes longer reports back
  under an unrelated context while echoing exactly what was asked for.
  That's why claims also record a `target` and `classify()` falls back
  to comparing values against *either* claim's target.
- Zigbee bulbs speak **mireds**, and HA's Kelvin↔mired conversions are
  both lossy `floor()`. Two Kelvin values flooring to the same mired are
  indistinguishable to the device, so `_color_temp_matches` treats them
  as equal on top of the plain tolerance.
- A bulb's advertised `min/max_color_temp_kelvin` is **not always
  honest** - `light.utility_spot_1` advertises max 4000 and reports
  5813. So `_already_set` accepts the raw target *or* the range-clamped
  one, never only the clamped one.
- `force` is the only bypass. There is no caller-supplied owner: a
  light's claims belong to whatever scope the caller names, so any
  caller naming that scope writes through it.
- **Scope is caller-supplied, not resolved.** Every tracking service
  (`apply_lighting`, `compute_lighting_groups`, `claims_check`,
  `claims_record`, `claims_clear`) takes `tracking_device_id` - a real HA
  device, one per state device (`StateInstance.device_info`).
  `ClaimRegistry.resolve_scope_device()` turns that into a subentry_id.
  **Optional only on `apply_lighting`/`compute_lighting_groups`** -
  both do something useful (dispatch/plan lights) with no scope at
  all, so omitting it means "write, but track nothing" (no claim,
  nothing excluded as externally-set). **Required on `claims_check`,
  `claims_record`, `claims_clear`** - each exists only to read or write
  tracking claims, so a call with nothing to name has nothing useful
  to do; the schema rejects a missing/null value outright (`vol.Required`,
  not `vol.Any(None, ...)`) rather than always silently answering
  "untracked" or recording nothing. A device_id that *is* given but
  isn't one of this entry's own state devices raises
  `ServiceValidationError` on any of the five, rather than behaving
  like it was omitted. **The old implicit resolver, `scope_for()`
  (entity → device → area, searched across every configured state
  device), has been removed entirely.** It was kept alive as an
  internal-only fallback for the state-changed listener and staleness
  pruning (the two call sites with no caller to ask), but tracing both
  showed it never actually had an effect: each only reaches a
  target-based lookup for an entity with no existing claim anywhere,
  and each immediately discards that result unless the entity is
  *already* claimed - which, if true, `_store_for()`'s direct
  claims-dict scan always finds first, without ever reaching
  `scope_for()`. Confirmed live: a user pointed out that a state
  device's setup form asking for a target implied claim ownership it
  didn't actually have. A state device's `target` now does exactly one
  thing - seeds `_assign_scope_area`'s best-effort, blank-only Area
  placement for the device's own registry entry (sensor.py) - and plays
  no part in which lights get tracked. The blueprint resolves
  `tracking_device_id` itself from `room_target` (its own
  `tracking_scope_device_id` variable) - area named directly wins
  outright, entities/a device with no area fall back to the first
  resolved light's own area - so this is invisible to a room
  automation; it only surfaces when calling the services directly.
- **Being switched off is an override.** `classify()` does *not*
  short-circuit on `not is_on`; an off light is judged against its
  claims like any other. A turn-off records `{"state": "off"}` as its
  target, which is what tells our own off from anyone else's once the
  context expires - without it a room turned off at bedtime classifies
  as `overridden` and can never be turned on again. That trap is the
  whole reason the recording exists, so don't drop it as redundant.
- **The blueprint's own turn-offs are bare `light.turn_off` calls**,
  not `apply_lighting`, so they record nothing on their own - each is
  followed by an explicit `flare.claims_record` step with the same
  `{"state": "off"}` target, guarded by
  `tracking_scope_device_id is not none` since `claims_record` now
  requires a scope - the same guard covers the `claims_clear` scene-
  handoff step. Without the record step every light in the room reads
  as externally switched off every time the room empties, which also
  fires `flare_light_overridden` for each of them; without the guard, a
  room with no resolvable scope would fail the tick outright instead of
  turning off untracked.
- **A scope releases every claim once none of its lights report `on`**
  (`ClaimRegistry._release_if_dark`). Anything not `on` counts as dark,
  unavailable included - requiring an explicit `off` would let one
  permanently unavailable entity veto the release forever, the same
  trap the blueprint's `recovered` trigger avoids. Note "the room" is
  the *scope*: an untracked light being on holds nothing open.

**Known limitation, partly mitigated.** Once `classify()` returns
`overridden`, `build_groups()` excludes the entity from every group, so
nothing ever records a fresher `latest` for it - and on a ramping curve
its recorded target only gets staler, so the value-rescue can't recover
it either. The scope-goes-dark release now clears this automatically
whenever the room empties, which covers the ordinary case; `claims_clear`
(and the Clear button) remains the escape hatch for a room that never
fully goes dark. The underlying rot is unchanged: an excluded entity
never gets a refreshed claim.

### Two config entries

The integration installs as **two** entries, not one: *Adaptive Lighting
Schedules* (day-phase/curve sensors) and *Adaptive Lighting Tracking*
(the services, the claim registry, and the state devices). Both use the
sensor platform; each platform module branches on
`entry.data[CONF_ENTRY_TYPE]`.

Why: HA's integration page renders **one section per subentry** with no
hook to group them by type (`subEntries.map(...)` in
`ha-config-entry-row.ts`), so a single entry flattened schedules and
scopes into one long list of peers - 19 of them on this house. The entry
is the only level at which the distinction can be expressed.

The services live with **tracking**, not schedules: every one of them is
about which lights are being driven and by whom, and they need the claim
registry that entry owns.

**One "Add Integration" creates both.** Two entries is a grouping
decision, never an argument for two trips through the flow -
`async_step_user` asks the single question there is to ask (which rooms
to track) and raises the other entry itself via `SOURCE_IMPORT`. Each
half is still creatable alone, so deleting one and adding it back
works. The entry the flow *visibly* completes on is always **Schedules**,
because Schedules creates no devices and Tracking seeds one per room -
see the device-dialog constraint below, which is what makes this
ordering load-bearing rather than arbitrary.

### Multi-sensor schedule architecture

The schedules entry registers no services and carries no schedule of its
own.
"Add Integration" creates **zero devices and zero entities** - that's
deliberate: HA's "integration added" dialog
(`step-flow-create-entry.ts`) shows a device-rename + area-picker form
whenever the completing flow has devices, with no way to suppress it,
and that dialog is also the only place HA ever auto-renames entity_ids
to match a device name. Auto-seeding a device therefore popped a rename
prompt for something the user hadn't asked for, and a later rename via
Settings → Devices silently didn't propagate to entity_ids.

**That constraint is narrower than it was once written up here**, and
the overstated version caused a wrong call once - re-verified against
home-assistant/frontend rather than recalled:

- The dialog is gated on the flow's own `showDevices`.
  `show-dialog-options-flow.ts` sets it **false**, so an options flow
  never renders it however many devices exist. The main config flow and
  `config_subentries_flow` set it true.
- `dialog-data-entry-flow.ts` then filters `hass.devices` by
  `device.config_entries.includes(entry_id)`, with `entry_id` taken from
  the flow *result* - so it is the completing flow's own entry, not any
  device anywhere.

Net: only the **main config flow, at entry creation** is affected, which
is exactly what the zero-devices rule above protects. Devices created
later are fine - and every schedule subentry already creates one, so the
entry is never device-free in practice. This is why the per-owner
entities (sensor.py's `owner_device_info`) do get a device each.

Every schedule is a named "sensor" subentry (Settings → Devices &
Services → Add Sensor). `schedule_instances(entry)` in `coordinator.py`
is the single place enumerating them; every other module iterates its
output. Each subentry gets its own device, and every entity uses
`has_entity_name=True`, so renaming the device renames every entity's
displayed name for free.

Per sensor:

- `sensor.<slug>_flare` - state is the phase name;
  `brightness`/`color_temp`/`rgb_color`, today's boundary timestamps,
  and `attributes.points` (289 samples, what the dashboard card reads)
  all live on this one entity. `points` is too large for the recorder,
  which `_unrecorded_attributes = frozenset({"points"})` handles - a
  plain per-attribute-name class field, needing no separate entity.
- `select.<slug>_flare_phase` - manual phase override,
  self-clearing at the next natural phase boundary unless
  `switch.<slug>_sticky_phase_override` is on. Implemented by comparing
  against the phase computed at override time on every refresh, not a
  timer.
- Five `time.*` boundaries and eight `number.*` curve values, as live
  `entity_category: config` entities.

**Config lives in entity state, not `subentry.data`** - `coordinator.py`
reads `hass.states.get(...)` for each. Writing back into `subentry.data`
was rejected: every subentry data change triggers a full entry reload,
recreating every coordinator and entity just to tweak one number. A
genuinely-missing entity falls back to the same default the entity
itself will report moments later, so `phase_at()` never sees a missing
boundary.

### Curve math (`curve.py`)

Every brightness/Kelvin literal is a keyword-only parameter with a named
default (`DEFAULT_CURVE_VALUES`, `DEFAULT_SCHEDULE_HOURS`). Non-obvious
facts:

- The brightness fade's span is **1.6× the nominal evening-to-night
  window**, not 1:1 - kept as a ratio so a custom brightness range
  keeps the same timing shape.
- The Kelvin evening tail is
  `evening_kelvin + (night_kelvin - evening_kelvin) * t`, continuous by
  construction.
- `day_phase` is a **parameter**, not derived from `now_ts` -
  `coordinator.py` passes a manually-overridden phase alongside the real
  time, so phase and instant can legitimately disagree. Every ramp
  clamps its interpolation factor for that reason.
- `kelvin_to_rgb` **delegates to
  `homeassistant.util.color.color_temperature_to_rgb`** rather than
  carrying its own copy. HA's is Tanner Helland's approximation (its own
  docstring says so) and was measured identical to the hand-written copy
  it replaced across 1000-10000K - zero units of difference on any
  channel. Don't reimplement it again.
  What is still ours is the round-half-up wrapper
  (`math.floor(x+0.5)`), matching the card's `Math.round` rather than
  Python's banker's rounding. **Measured, that is currently
  unobservable** - no integer Kelvin in range lands on an exact .5, and
  `kelvin_for_phase` only ever passes integers - so `round()` would pass
  every test today. It is kept deliberately, and the docstring says as
  much so nobody "simplifies" it on the assumption the equivalence is
  permanent. Truncating instead DOES break three tests including both
  parity tests.
  One behaviour change came with the delegation: HA clamps input to
  1000-40000K where the old copy extrapolated. The `number` entities are
  bounded 1000-10000, but `compute_curve`'s schema is not.
  `test_below_1000k_clamps_instead_of_extrapolating` pins it - and note
  that test is a **dependency contract**, not a logic test: the clamping
  is HA's code, so there is nothing of ours to mutate against it.

**Do not re-add `night_floor_kelvin` or `kelvin_rgb`.** Both were cut
deliberately at the user's direction. RGB is just the Kelvin→RGB
conversion of `kelvin`; there is no separate RGB curve.

### Blueprint (`blueprints/automation/danspencer/flare.yaml`)

**`room_target`** is a single entity/device/area/floor/label `target`
doing double duty: lights within it are controlled, occupancy-class
`binary_sensor`s within it govern occupancy via HA's native `occupancy`
integration (2026.4+). That integration filters strictly by
`device_class: occupancy` - motion-class sensors are never picked up,
even targeted directly. Both `occupancy.*` schemas require `target:` to
be present though every field inside is optional, which is why
`room_target` defaults to `{}` rather than `null`.

`room_target` is resolved **once**, into `target_named_entities` +
`target_expanded_entities`, which the three consumers filter:
`resolved_entities` (lights), `room_occupancy_entities`
(occupancy-class binary_sensors), `scope_entities` (scene scope). The
halves are kept apart because a *directly named* light also pulls in its
device's siblings while the device/area halves already return those -
merging them would silently widen scene scope. Entity/device/area only;
floor/label aren't resolvable in hand-rolled Jinja, a pre-existing gap
shared with the native trigger path.

`room_occupancy_entities` exists only to decide *whether* the room has
an occupancy sensor at all. That matters because
`occupancy.is_detected`'s `any`-across-target semantics are vacuously
**false** over a target matching zero entities - so a light-only room
would otherwise permanently fail the condition.

**Triggers:** `adaptive` (state on the sensor, filtered `to:` the four
phase names so attribute-only ticks don't fire), `adaptive_tick`
(`time_pattern`, `!input update_interval`), `extra`, `motion_on` /
`motion_off` (`occupancy.detected`/`cleared`), `recovered`.

- `adaptive` needs the `to:` filter because a plain `state` trigger with
  no `from`/`to` fires on attribute-only changes; with any of those keys
  set HA rejects events where `old_value == new_value`.
- `adaptive_tick` exists because the curve is **flat** during Morning
  and Night, so the coordinator re-writes identical state and HA emits
  `state_reported`, not `state_changed` - `adaptive` goes silent
  entirely in those phases.
- `recovered` arms on "at least one of our lights is reachable", firing
  as the first bulb returns. The inverse ("none unavailable") is wrong:
  one permanently-unavailable orphan holds it false forever and disables
  recovery for the whole room. Accepted blind spot: one flaky bulb
  recovering beside healthy siblings doesn't move the aggregate;
  `adaptive_tick` mops that up.
- `recovered`'s `value_template` **cannot reference `trigger.*`** - HA
  renders it with only `trigger_variables` in scope, injecting `trigger`
  afterwards for the fired action only. An earlier version referenced
  `trigger.entity_id` there and could never fire at all.

**Jitter:** a `delay:` step, first in `action:`, renders
`range(0, update_jitter+1) | random` for `adaptive`/`adaptive_tick` and
`0` otherwise (HA short-circuits a zero delay synchronously). Spreads
writes so rooms sharing one sensor don't all command at the same instant.
`mode: restart` means a genuine trigger mid-jitter correctly preempts.

**`condition:`** only decides whether the tick is relevant at all. It
does **not** check occupancy: occupancy's only two jobs are turning a
room on (`motion_on` + `allow_turn_on`) and off once empty. Gating
adaptive ticks on it just meant an already-on light got skipped.

**`allow_turn_on` = `manual_run or trigger.id == 'motion_on' or
occupied`. This must never gain a new way to become true without the
user explicitly asking for it in so many words** - not implied, not
inferred as reasonable. The user's position on this is emphatic and
standing. Note `automation.trigger` from another automation counts as a
manual run (`trigger` is defined, `trigger.id` isn't), so anyone wanting
an event to light a room writes their own automation that calls it - no
blueprint input needed.

**It is a single structural gate, not a rule each path re-implements.**
Exactly two things in the blueprint can switch a light on -
`scene.turn_on` and `flare.apply_lighting` - and both sit inside one
`if allow_turn_on` block in `default:`. Nothing else in `action:` ever
writes an "on" state (the rest is two `light.turn_off` and three
`claims_*` bookkeeping steps). Anything added later that can switch a
light on belongs in that same block; `tests/integration/test_blueprint.py`'s
`test_no_trigger_reaching_default_can_light_a_dark_empty_room` sweeps
every trigger reaching `default:` to enforce it.

This shape was arrived at the hard way. The rule used to be enforced two
different ways - `apply_lighting` by filtering its own
`adaptive_target_entities` list, and the scene not at all - so a phase
change lit an empty Dining Room's 14 fixtures at 23:00 and self-heal
undid it 9 seconds later, every night. **Do not re-add the per-entity
filter** (`reject('is_state', 'off')` when `allow_turn_on` is false): it
was redundant, not load-bearing. `occupied` ("a light is on") is itself
one of the three ways `allow_turn_on` becomes true, so a false
`allow_turn_on` already means nothing in the room is on - the filter
could only ever return `unavailable`/`unknown` entities, which
`grouping.py` drops as unreachable. Answering a room-level permission
question per-entity is exactly what let the scene path miss it.

**Self-heal** shares `adaptive_tick` rather than its own interval. Its
eligibility checks sit in the `choose:` branch's own `conditions:`, so a
tick that doesn't qualify falls through to `default:` and reapplies
lighting normally. It stays **exclusive** of `default:` deliberately:
`entities_still_on`/`adaptive_target_entities` are computed once before
`action:` runs, so reapplying in the same run risks `apply_lighting`
turning a just-turned-off light straight back on. It requires occupancy
continuously clear for the full Wait time, checked with a hand-written
`now() - last_changed` template rather than
`occupancy.is_not_detected`'s native `for:` - that needs the recorder to
prime a duration already satisfied before the condition started
watching, which isn't reliable right after a restart.

**Phase names appear in three inputs** - `rgb_phases`, the four
per-phase scene pickers, and the four per-phase exclude lists. A
deliberate exception to "the blueprint doesn't know phase names",
explicitly chosen. All phase-keyed dict lookups use `.get(key, default)`,
never direct indexing: `states(adaptive_sensor)` can legitimately be
`unknown`/`unavailable`, and direct indexing would crash the whole tick.
`scene_template` wins over the per-phase pick whenever it returns a valid
scene; `brightness_multiplier_template`'s per-entity values likewise win
over the phase exclude lists (`dict(phase_base, **template_result)`).

**`0` and `null` multipliers are not the same thing.** `0` means "turn
this light off"; `null`/`false` means "hands off, something else owns
it" - excluded from the turn-off paths too, not just the adaptive step.
In Jinja as in Python `0 == false`, so membership tests like
`in [none, false]` silently swallow every `0`; the identity form
`multiplier is none or multiplier is sameas false` is required, mirroring
`grouping.py`'s own bucketing.

**`variables:` renders strictly top to bottom**, each key seeing only
those above it, and failures are silent (`x | length` on an undefined
name returns `0` with no log and no trace entry). The brightness-
multiplier chain sits near the top specifically because the turn-off
lists depend on it.

**Sensor reads are guarded before dispatch.** `brightness`/
`color_temp_kelvin` are plain `state_attr()` reads and `apply_lighting`
requires both, so an unavailable or renamed sensor would fail validation
every tick. The guard wraps that one action step rather than
`condition:`, because `motion_off` and self-heal turn lights *off* and
need nothing from the sensor.

**`device_class: occupancy` does not mean the sensor can tell whether
someone is still in the room.** Most sensors here are plain PIR motion
sensors: they report clear the moment motion stops, including while
someone sits still, then flip back on the next movement. Rapid on/off
flapping is normal, not a fault. `no_motion_wait` exists to turn "motion
stopped a moment ago" into a usable proxy for "the room is empty". Only
a couple of sensors here are genuine mmWave presence sensors, and the
blueprint can't tell the two apart - both just present as
`device_class: occupancy` - so Wait time is sized for the PIR case
everywhere.

Nightlight-style overrides need no dedicated mechanism: a template
`binary_sensor` with `device_class: occupancy`, named directly in
`room_target`, gets full native `occupancy.*` support, since the
trigger/condition machinery only looks at entity state, not origin.

### Standing decisions - don't re-propose without new information

- **Extracting target resolution into a service or a Jinja macro.**
  `condition:` can't call services and runs before `action:`; a
  `custom_templates/*.jinja` macro needs a full HA restart to load
  (lesson 2) and would add a manual install step to an otherwise
  self-contained blueprint; registering a global Jinja function means
  monkey-patching the shared template engine. Deduplicating *within*
  `variables:` has none of those blockers and is what's actually done.
- **Condition/action-selector inputs replacing `scene_template` /
  `brightness_multiplier_template`.** Investigated properly against
  `blueprint/models.py` and `annotatedyaml`. A blueprint input's
  `default:` cannot reference another input's value (the `blueprint:`
  key is discarded before substitution). Brightness has no viable
  selector at all - it returns a *value*, which neither `action` nor
  `condition` can produce. Scene handoff is convertible only by giving
  up gap-fill, since a native condition evaluates structurally too late
  to feed the single Jinja pass that computes it.
- **`activating_triggers`** (a second Additional Triggers input allowed
  to turn lights on). Built, shipped, then reverted: "added complexity
  for something that someone can just do via another automation".
- **`night_floor_kelvin` / `kelvin_rgb`** - see Curve math above.
- **An opt-out for the two-step repair** - HA's issue registry already
  provides Ignore, and an ignored issue survives version bumps.
  Documented in `docs/helpers.md` rather than reimplemented.
- **Virtual per-phase `light` entities** replacing the eight curve
  `number`s, so a phase is set from a normal light card (and gains RGB).
  Rejected on Liskov: a phase target has no off state, so `turn_off`
  would have to lie - and it must, because `light.turn_off` with
  `entity_id: all` reaches it regardless of `entity_category` or
  `hidden_by` (`helpers/service.py`'s `target_all_entities` branch is
  `return list(entities.values())`; `all` skips target resolution by
  definition). An always-on light also reports `on` in every
  `states.light` template.
  **Revisit if HA changes either half of that** - a colour-picker card
  feature, or card features usable on a non-light entity. Today all
  three light features gate on `computeDomain(...) === "light"` and
  write via `light.turn_on`, and there is no colour-picker feature at
  all (the wheel lives only in `ha-more-info-light`) - which is the
  whole reason `flare-kelvin-feature.js` /
  `flare-brightness-feature.js` / `flare-value-slider.js` exist.
  **The gate is always the entity_id's domain PREFIX** - `computeDomain()`
  in the features, and again when more-info picks its control element
  (no aliasing, no fallback for an unknown domain). Python class
  hierarchy, `device_class` and state attributes are all invisible to
  it, so a bespoke `virtual_light` domain inheriting `LightEntity` gets
  none of these controls. An empty light group is not a route either:
  `group/light.py` derives every attribute from its members and
  *forwards* `turn_on` to them, so with none it stores nothing, offers
  `{ColorMode.ONOFF}` and reports unavailable.

### Parked: scene handling in `apply_lighting`

Not implemented; recorded so it isn't re-derived. Two designs:

1. **Straight port** - `apply_lighting` gains optional
   `scene_entity_id`/`scope_entities`, calls `compute_scene_coverage`
   internally, then `scene.turn_on` plus dispatch on
   `uncovered_entities`. Known cost: loses the `condition:`-level
   suppression that stops the tick running while a scene owns the room.
   Accepted as fine if picked up.
2. **Bigger idea** - read a scene's *stored* per-entity values and feed
   them through the grouping/multiplier pipeline, so a brightness
   multiplier could scale a scene's own brightness (which it explicitly
   cannot today). `ha_config_get_scene` does expose full per-entity
   attributes, but: a scene captures whichever colour mode was active
   when recorded (`xy`/`hs`/`color_temp` can all appear in one scene,
   and `apply_lighting` understands only colour-temp and RGB), reading
   stored scene config is a less-trodden surface than the
   `hass.states`/registry trio used everywhere else, and scenes can
   carry `effect` and non-light domains. Treat as its own decision, not
   a prerequisite for (1).

### Two-step transition detection

`two_step.py` is pure, `two_step_check.py` is the registry adapter,
`repairs.py` is the fix flow. Case-insensitive globs matched against
`"<manufacturer> <model>"`. The options field is **seeded with the
shipped defaults and holds the whole list** - a saved value replaces
them outright, so deleting a shipped pattern takes effect. An
empty/whitespace field falls back to the defaults, so clearing the box
can't silently disable detection.

**Accepted trade-off:** once a user saves the field they own it, and a
later release adding a newly-discovered bulb won't reach them. Chosen
for consistency over reach; PR updates still reach every install that
hasn't customised it.

The fix applies the label to the **device**, not the entity -
`grouping.py` accepts either, but device survives entity renames and
covers every light entity the device exposes. It also *creates* the
label if absent, which is what guarantees the `label_id` is right, since
HA derives the id from the name at creation.

### Blueprint version checking

`blueprint_version.py` is pure (the stamp constant + parsing),
`blueprint_check.py` is the HA adapter, `repairs.py` carries the fix
flow - the same three-way split `two_step.py`/`two_step_check.py`/
`repairs.py` already uses.

**`BLUEPRINT_VERSION` is the version the BLUEPRINT last changed in, not
the integration's.** Chosen at the user's direction over "any
difference", so a release touching only Python doesn't tell every user
to re-import an identical file. That is the whole reason it is a
separate constant rather than read from `manifest.json`, and it is why
it must be bumped BY HAND whenever the blueprint changes - forgetting
fails silently (no repair, no error, nobody hears about the update).
Two things guard it: `tests/test_blueprint_version.py` pins the constant
against the stamp in the blueprint's own description, and a
`blueprint-stamp` job in `tests.yml` fails any PR that touches
`blueprints/` without moving the stamp.

**The stamp lives in the blueprint's `description`** because there is
nowhere else. `blueprint/schemas.py` validates the `blueprint:` block
against a CLOSED voluptuous schema (name/description/domain/source_url/
author/homeassistant/input), so there is no custom key; a top-level key
alongside `blueprint:` lands in the generated *automation* config
instead. `description` is free text, survives any import route, is
readable via `Blueprint.metadata` with no filesystem access, and shows
the version to the user in the automation editor.

**Two repairs, mutually exclusive.** `blueprint_not_installed` fires
when no copy of our blueprint exists at all; `outdated_blueprint` when
an in-use copy is stale. `async_check` clears whichever it isn't
raising, so a house moving between the two states leaves nothing behind.

- **The missing check deliberately does NOT ask whether anyone is using
  it.** Chosen at the user's direction over a narrower "FLARE is set up
  and nothing is driving it" guard, and the reasoning is the point:
  someone can arrive from the HACS store with no idea a blueprint
  exists, install the integration, and reasonably wonder why nothing
  happened. An installed-but-unused blueprint still counts as installed
  (mid-setup, not stuck), which is the one case where the two checks
  genuinely differ. Anyone going services-only ignores it, which HA
  remembers across version bumps.
- **`IssueSeverity` has no INFO level** - WARNING is the floor, which is
  why the wording carries the "the blueprint is optional" line rather
  than the severity carrying it.
- **The install path is `danrspencer/flare.yaml`** (`INSTALL_PATH`), the
  owner spelling HA derives from a GitHub import, NOT this repo's
  `danspencer/` folder - so a user who later clicks the docs' import
  badge overwrites the same file instead of ending up with two copies
  at two paths. See lesson 13.
- **The install uses `allow_override=False`**, unlike the update path:
  it exists only for the no-blueprint case, and silently overwriting
  something that appeared between the check and the Fix press is what
  the other repair is for.
- **Only blueprints an automation actually uses are reported**
  (`automations_with_blueprint`). HA never removes an unreferenced
  blueprint, and lesson 13's owner-vs-folder mismatch means a house can
  hold an orphan at a second path forever - a repair about a file
  nothing reads is noise the user can't silence.
- **The fix fetches a commit-pinned tag**, not `main` (lesson 12), and
  writes to whatever path the stale copy was found at rather than the
  path HA would derive. `async_add_blueprint(..., allow_override=True)`
  reloads the consuming automations itself.
- **The check runs via `async_at_started`, not during setup** -
  automations decide whether a blueprint is in use, and during setup
  they may not have loaded, so checking early finds every blueprint
  orphaned and reports nothing. Tracking entry only, so a house with
  both entries doesn't run it twice.
- A blueprint that fails to load comes back from
  `async_get_blueprints()` as the **exception**, not a `Blueprint` -
  hence the `isinstance` check, not a `None` check.
- **Promoting a beta:** if the blueprint changed during a beta the stamp
  holds that beta's version, and it must be set to the stable version
  when promoting. `release.yml` enforces this rather than trusting
  anyone to remember - a stable tag whose stamp carries a prerelease
  suffix fails the release outright. It also refuses a stamp naming a
  tag that doesn't exist, since that is the URL the Fix button
  downloads from, and both failures are otherwise silent until a user
  presses Fix.

**`tests/integration/test_blueprint_version_repair.py` overrides
`hass_config_dir` to COPY `blueprints/` instead of symlinking it.** The
shared fixture symlinks the real directory, so a test writing blueprint
files writes them into the actual repo - which happened while this was
being written, and four junk blueprints were staged before it was
caught. Don't "simplify" it back to the shared fixture.

### Deployment / operational notes

- **Versioning**: `manifest.json`'s `version` is what HACS reports, and
  it must match the release tag - enforced by `tests/test_version.py`
  and again by `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which refuses to publish
  a mismatch. `CHANGELOG.md` must carry a section for the version.
  Releasing is bump + changelog + tag; see CONTRIBUTING.md.
- **Integration**: HACS. `update_information` then `download`, confirm
  the deployed file matches the merge with `ha_read_file` before
  restarting (see lesson 12), then restart.
- **Blueprint**: `ha_import_blueprint` with `overwrite=true`, pinned to
  a commit SHA rather than a branch (lesson 12). Note lesson 13 - it
  installs under `danrspencer/`, not `danspencer/`.
- The two halves deploy separately, so a brief window where a restarted
  integration meets a not-yet-reimported blueprint is expected and
  self-resolves.
- **The dashboard front-end files ship inside the integration**
  (`custom_components/flare/www/`) and self-register
  via `async_setup` → `async_register_static_paths` +
  `add_extra_js_url`. Two of them now: `flare-curve-card.js` (a card)
  and `flare-kelvin-feature.js` (a *card feature* - registered on
  `window.customCardFeatures`, not `customCards`; the older
  `customTileFeatures` name is not used). One StaticPathConfig serves
  the directory, so each new file needs only its own
  `add_extra_js_url`. The feature imports `kelvinToRgb` from the card
  rather than copying it, so its fill colour and the chart agree by
  construction - ES modules are per-URL singletons, so the shared
  import costs nothing. It renders `ha-control-slider` - the frontend's
  own element, the one the built-in `numeric-input` feature uses -
  styled with a copy of the frontend's `cardFeatureStyles` block for it,
  differing only in the two colour properties: the built-in points both
  `--control-slider-color` and `--control-slider-background` at
  `--feature-color`, this points both at the colour of the value, so
  the fill is solid and the remainder is that same colour at the same
  native 0.2 opacity. So the handle, rounded fill cap, tooltip and
  keyboard behaviour are HA's, and only the hue is ours; the tile's
  phase colour still shows on the icon. **The drag handle cannot be recoloured**:
  `ha-control-slider` hardcodes it to white on
  `.slider .slider-track-bar::after`, with no custom property and no
  `part=`, so at the pale end of the ramp (near 6667K the colour *is*
  nearly white) it blends into the fill. Injecting a rule into the
  slider's own shadow root was built, shipped in 0.10.6 and reverted in
  0.10.7 at the user's direction: it coupled to an internal class name,
  and it silently did nothing in practice because a Lit element only
  has a `shadowRoot` once connected, which the test stub (attaching in
  its constructor) was too forgiving to catch. **Don't re-attempt it
  without a supported hook.** **Two earlier versions are
  recorded in the file's header so they aren't re-attempted:** a
  full warm-to-cool gradient track (reads as a colour picker, not as one
  of a column of sliders), then a hand-rolled `<input type="range">`
  (right colour, but reimplemented the handle and fill cap and visibly
  didn't match). Depending on `ha-control-slider` is an accepted risk,
  taken at the user's direction - it is a frontend internal with no
  compatibility promise, so if it breaks, follow whatever
  `hui-numeric-input-card-feature.ts` does next. **`flare-value-slider.js`
  holds everything the two features share** (waiting for
  `ha-control-slider`, the `cardFeatureStyles` copy, commit-on-changed /
  repaint-on-moved); kelvin and brightness differ only in which entities
  they accept and what colour a value maps to. Brightness has no colour
  of its own, so it BORROWS one: `tint_from` names a colour-temperature
  entity (the section passes the same phase's Kelvin entity) and the
  fill is that colour, SOLID, with the fill's width carrying the value -
  which is what HA's own `light-brightness` feature does with a bulb's
  colour. Hence colour temperature sits LEFT of brightness in both pair
  grids: the colour is decided there and carried across. With no
  readable `tint_from` it falls back to `--primary-color`, which is also
  `ha-control-slider`'s own default fill, so it degrades to the stock
  slider. **Two fill treatments were tried and dropped**: fading the
  fill by value (redundant - the width already says it, and it only
  made a dim setting harder to see) and white-to-transparent (invisible
  at full brightness on a light theme). The unfilled track is left
  to the element's own `--disabled-color`, NOT the tile colour that
  `cardFeatureStyles` uses: a phase-tinted track under a value-tinted
  fill reads as two things fighting. It exists because a tile's slider takes
  its colour from `--feature-color`, which `hui-tile-card` sets to
  `var(--tile-color)`, and a tile `color` accepts no template - so the
  built-in `numeric-input` cannot show a value as a colour while the
  tile colour means something else. card-mod can, and was rejected: the
  generator's promise is paste-and-go with no third-party dependency.
  Built on `<input type="range">` rather than `ha-control-slider` for
  the same reason - no dependency on frontend internals. **The URL carries the integration version**
  (`/flare_static/<version>/...`) with `cache_headers=True`. It was an
  unversioned path with `cache_headers=False`, which **does not do what
  it sounds like**: that only omits `Cache-Control`, leaving `ETag` and
  `Last-Modified`, so browsers fall back to *heuristic* caching (roughly
  10% of the age since `Last-Modified`). Safari applies that keenly -
  confirmed live, where a just-deployed card and feature both rendered
  as "Configuration error" until the window lapsed, then "fixed
  themselves". With a version per release a cached copy can never be
  taken for the current one, so caching hard is correct rather than
  merely tolerable. **It must be a path segment, not `?v=`**: these
  modules import each other relatively, and a relative import resolves
  against the importing module's own URL - a path is inherited by those
  imports, a query is not, so `?v=` would load the card twice under two
  URLs and the second `customElements.define` would throw. That
  relative-import invariant is pinned by
  `tests/test_static_imports.py`. This replaced a separate symlink path
  that silently went stale for over a week.
- `scripts/link_into_ha.sh` was **deleted**, not fixed - once the cards
  travel with the integration there was nothing left for it to do, and
  untested deploy tooling nobody runs is a liability (lesson 7).
- **The integration icon must live inside the integration's own folder**
  (`custom_components/flare/brand/`, HA 2026.3.0+),
  not the repo root. `home-assistant/brands` no longer accepts custom
  integrations. Root `brand/` is authoring tooling only; the served PNGs
  need re-rendering by hand after a design change. HA serves them from
  `/api/brands/integration/flare/icon.png`, gated on `has_branding` -
  which is just `"brand" in top_level_files` (`loader.py`), so the
  directory existing in the installed folder is the whole requirement,
  no manifest key.

  **Every HACS-rendered surface ignores that and is not fixable from
  here** ([hacs/integration#5171](https://github.com/hacs/integration/issues/5171)).
  Verified rather than assumed: HACS sets its update entity's
  `entity_picture` to `https://brands.home-assistant.io/_/flare/icon.png`
  outright, and that CDN returns **200 for any domain at all** - a
  generated grey placeholder - so there is no 404 to detect and nothing
  a repo-side change can influence. That covers both the HACS store card
  and Settings -> System -> Updates, since the latter renders HACS's
  entity. HA's own integrations page uses the local path and is
  unaffected. The one HACS surface we *can* reach is the README, which
  it renders in the repository panel - hence the icon at the top of it.
- pyscript is fully gone from both this repo and the live host.
- **The dashboard ships as a Lovelace VIEW STRATEGY, not as pasted
  YAML.** `views: - strategy: {type: custom:flare}` resolves to
  `ll-strategy-view-flare` (`flare-view-strategy.js`), which builds one
  section per schedule sensor from `flare-section.js`. That file is the
  single definition of the layout and is a plain config OBJECT, not a
  string, because a strategy hands HA objects. It registers nothing, so
  it has no `add_extra_js_url` of its own - the strategy's import pulls
  it in.
  **This replaced a generator on the docs site** that emitted the same
  section as YAML to copy-paste. The generator, its CSS and its tests
  were deleted outright. Reason: the layout changed five times in a
  single session, and each change meant every user re-generating and
  re-pasting a section per schedule; a strategy is regenerated on every
  dashboard load, so a HACS update is the whole migration, and a newly
  added schedule sensor simply appears. The escape hatch for someone who
  wants to own the YAML is HA's own "Take control", which is one-way.
  When the port landed, `sectionConfig()`'s output was diffed against
  the generator's last output and was byte-identical - worth repeating
  if this is ever restructured again.
- **Two view strategies, not one**: `custom:flare-schedule` and
  `custom:flare-tracking`, registered as
  `ll-strategy-view-flare-schedule` and
  `ll-strategy-view-flare-tracking`. The schedule one was plain
  `custom:flare` in 0.12.x, while it was the only one; renamed in 0.14.0
  because the bare name gives no hint which of the two you get. Kept
  apart because a house has one scope per room against a handful of
  schedules, so merging would bury the schedules, and they answer
  different questions - what a light should be doing versus who
  currently owns it. **The suffix test matters**: a scope's sensor is
  `sensor.<slug>_flare_tracking`, which ends with `_flare` *plus more*,
  so `endsWith('_flare')` is load-bearing - `includes('_flare')` would
  put every scope in the schedule view. Both enumerators also require a
  distinguishing attribute (`points` / `claims`) so a name alone is
  never enough.
- **The chart is one filled path, not a bar per sample.** It used to
  draw a `<rect>` per five-minute sample, which made every ramp a
  staircase. `curveFillSvg`/`simplifyPolyline`/`roundedTopEdge` in the
  card are exported and covered by `tests/test_curve_chart.py`. Only
  the GEOMETRY is simplified (the curve is piecewise linear, so most
  sample points are redundant as shape) - the gradient still carries a
  stop per sample, because colour moves continuously where brightness
  does not. Corner easing uses a quadratic whose **control point is the
  corner itself**, which is contained within the corner and so can only
  cut inward; do not replace it with an interpolating spline
  (Catmull-Rom and friends), which would overshoot the flat tops and
  draw brightness the schedule never asks for.
- **The docs site is how the card gets previewed without HA.**
  `docs/playground.html` loads the real
  `flare-curve-card.js` and feeds it the state shape a live
  HA would, with sliders for every schedule and curve value. Build the
  site and serve `docs/_preview/` (`.claude/launch.json`'s `docs-site`),
  which symlinks `flare` -> `_site` so the site's `/flare` baseurl
  resolves. Verify by reading the rendered
  shadow DOM directly; screenshot capture has been unreliable here.
  This replaced `dashboard/preview.html` + `generate_preview_data.py`
  and a `render_preview_svg.py` that rendered a static SVG for the
  README - all three deleted. The SVG renderer was a third copy of the
  chart's drawing logic and had already drifted from the card.

## Testing

`pip install pytest pytest-homeassistant-custom-component && pytest`
from the repo root (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`). Python 3.14 - the floor
tracks whatever pytest-homeassistant-custom-component's pinned HA
release requires, since this only ever runs inside a real HA install.
`pip install -e ".[dev]"` does *not* work here and isn't used anywhere:
the flat repo layout isn't set up for setuptools discovery and doesn't
need to be, since nothing is distributed as a Python package. `dev` in
`pyproject.toml` is a versions reference only.

Two layers:

- **Pure** (`test_curve.py`, `test_grouping.py`, `test_scenes.py`,
  `test_override_protection.py`, `test_two_step.py`,
  `test_services_yaml.py`). `tests/conftest.py` puts the component
  directory on `sys.path` so these import `curve`/`grouping` as bare
  modules rather than through the package (which would pull in
  `homeassistant` via `__init__.py`); `tests/fakes.py` provides a fake
  `EntityLookup` so `grouping.py` runs on plain dicts. Note these still
  need `homeassistant` importable - `override_protection.py` and
  `curve.py` both import `homeassistant.util.color`, and pytest's own `testpaths` collects
  `tests/integration/conftest.py` regardless of which file you target.
- **Integration** (`tests/integration/`), real HA via
  [pytest-homeassistant-custom-component](https://github.com/MatthewFlamm/pytest-homeassistant-custom-component).
  `test_services.py` exercises the registered services end-to-end,
  calling `async_setup_entry` directly rather than
  `hass.config_entries.async_setup()` - the latter resolves the
  manifest's `http`/`frontend` dependencies and pulls in the large
  `home-assistant-frontend` package for something these tests never
  touch. `test_blueprint.py` loads the real blueprint into a test
  automation and fires real triggers, mocking only `apply_lighting` /
  `scene.turn_on` / `light.turn_off`.

`test_blueprint.py` is the **only** layer that can catch a bug in the
blueprint's own trigger/condition/action wiring - syntactically fine,
wrong only at runtime, invisible to YAML parsing or an isolated
`ha_eval_template` check. Its classes mirror `docs/blueprint.md`'s
section headings so it reads as a spec of what the blueprint does.

`tests/integration/conftest.py` overrides the plugin's own
`hass_config_dir` fixture (which otherwise points at its bundled
`testing_config/`) to symlink this repo's `custom_components/` and
`blueprints/` into a throwaway `tmp_path`.

**Practices this repo relies on, worth keeping:**

- **Mutation-verify every behavioural change**: break the fix
  deliberately, confirm *exactly* the intended test(s) fail, restore.
  This has repeatedly caught tests that passed for the wrong reason.
  Commit before mutating - `git checkout <file>` to undo a mutation
  will silently discard uncommitted work in that file.
- Timing tests use the file-wide `frozen_time` fixture
  (`freeze_time(..., real_asyncio=True)`) and call `.tick()`/`.move_to()`
  on it. **Never open a nested `freeze_time`**, and never freeze without
  `real_asyncio=True`: plain `freeze_time` also mocks
  `time.monotonic()`, which is the clock asyncio's event loop uses for
  every timer, and a live loop does not tolerate that - it hangs, or
  fires timers wildly out of order.
- `async_fire_time_changed` fires the event that trips a `time_pattern`
  trigger but does **not** advance `now()`. A template comparing
  `now() - last_changed` needs frozen time ticked forward explicitly.
- Advance time relative to `utcnow()`, never to an absolute
  `.replace(minute=N)` - the latter can target a time in the past
  depending on real wall-clock alignment at run time.
- Two consecutive `hass.states.async_set` calls with identical values
  collapse into one `state_reported` event, and the second call's
  explicit `context=` is silently discarded. Echo a *slightly*
  different value when a test needs a real state change.
- The plugin's `mock_storage` caches a `Store` instance's first load
  and never refreshes it, so reading back a write made through a
  different `Store` for the same key needs a **fresh** instance. Never
  an issue in production, where exactly one tracker is created.
- A real entity-registry change triggers `two_step_check.py`'s
  5s-debounced watcher; flush it or the harness fails on a lingering
  timer.
