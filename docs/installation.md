# Quickstart
{: .no_toc }

Five minutes to a room running on the curve. This covers the standard setup; anything
unusual is in [Power users]({{ site.baseurl }}/advanced/).

{: .note }
> **Prerequisites** — Home Assistant 2026.4.0 or newer (the blueprint uses the native
> `occupancy.*` triggers), [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) installed, and your lights assigned to
> areas. Areas aren't strictly required, but FLARE offers to set itself up per room from
> them, which saves most of the work.

## Step 1 — install via HACS

HACS → three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**. Add:

```
https://github.com/danrspencer/flare
```

with type **Integration**. Then find **FLARE** in the HACS list and download it.

{: .tip }
> The dashboard card ships inside the integration and registers itself — no Lovelace
> resource to add.

## Step 2 — restart, then add FLARE

Restart Home Assistant, then **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → FLARE**.

Adding it once creates both of FLARE's entries. The only thing it asks for is which
rooms to track:

- **FLARE Schedules** — the day-phase and colour curve. Add a schedule sensor per part of
  the house that should share a rhythm; one for the whole house is fine to start.
- **FLARE Tracking** — which lights FLARE is currently driving. Every area containing
  lights is offered, pre-selected, and each one you keep becomes a tracking scope. Trim
  the list if you like; anything you leave out simply isn't tracked.

Scopes can be added, retargeted or removed at any time from the Tracking entry.

{: .note }
> Adding another schedule sensor or state device later shows a Home Assistant entry
> picker offering **both FLARE Schedules and FLARE Tracking**, regardless of which one
> you clicked "Add" from — a Home Assistant frontend quirk, not a FLARE bug: the picker
> lists every entry for the domain before checking which one actually supports what
> you're adding. Pick the entry matching what you clicked (Schedules for a schedule
> sensor, Tracking for a state device) — picking the other one simply fails rather than
> creating anything in the wrong place.

Each schedule sensor gets its own device, with the phase boundaries, curve values and
transition durations as ordinary entities you can edit from the device page.

## Step 3 — import the blueprint and create an automation

[![Import blueprint](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdanrspencer%2Fflare%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fdanspencer%2Fflare.yaml)

Create an automation from it and fill in two things:

| Input | What to put |
|---|---|
| **FLARE Sensor** | The schedule sensor from step 2. |
| **Lights & Occupancy** | One target for the room — pick the **area**. Lights inside it get driven; occupancy-class binary sensors inside it decide when. |

That's the minimum. Everything else has a working default.

{: .note }
> Occupancy is optional. With no occupancy sensor in the target, FLARE keeps the room's
> lights on the curve but never turns them on or off by itself.

Repeat per room. Rooms can share a schedule sensor — the update jitter setting exists so
they don't all issue commands in the same instant.

## Step 4 — add the card (optional)

On Home Assistant 2026.6 or newer, add a card, open the **By entity** tab, and pick your
schedule sensor — **FLARE Curve** appears under *Community* with a live preview, and lands
full-width with no YAML at all.

Otherwise, add a **Manual** card to any dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:flare-curve-card
sensor: ground_floor
```

`sensor` is the schedule sensor's slug — `ground_floor` for `sensor.ground_floor_flare`. The
card draws the day's brightness and colour curve with a marker at the current time.

{: .tip }
> Want the curve alongside a phase override and every schedule/curve entity as tiles,
> not just the chart? Add FLARE's ready-made
> [dashboard view]({{ site.baseurl }}/dashboard/) — one line of config, and it builds
> a section per schedule sensor for you.

## What now

- Lights not behaving as you expect? Each tracking scope has **Controlled** and
  **Overridden** counters and a **Clear** button — see
  [the integration reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/advanced/reference/#override-protection).
- Want a scene to own the room at certain times?
  [Scene handoff]({{ site.baseurl }}/advanced/scenes/).
- Want to skip the blueprint entirely?
  [Building without it]({{ site.baseurl }}/advanced/custom-automations/).
- Every blueprint input, with defaults: [Blueprint reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/blueprint/).
