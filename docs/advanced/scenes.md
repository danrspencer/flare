# Scene handoff
{: .no_toc }

FLARE is built to share a room. A scene, a wall switch, or another automation can take a
light at any time — this is how FLARE notices, steps back, and picks the light up again
afterwards.

## How a handoff works

When the blueprint hands a room to a scene it activates the scene, then calls
`flare.claims_clear` for the lights that scene covers. The clear matters: without it FLARE
would keep its old claim, see the scene's values, and classify them as an override.

Lights the scene doesn't cover keep getting the adaptive values, so a scene naming half a
room leaves the other half to FLARE.

## `flare.compute_scene_coverage`

Given a candidate scene and the entities you want a default behaviour applied to, works out which of those
entities the scene actually covers — hand covered ones to the scene, apply your default (adaptive lighting or
anything else) to whatever's left. A scene only counts if it exists and everything it covers is within
`scope_entities`; a scene reaching outside that scope, or one that doesn't exist, is treated the same as no scene
at all. Nothing here is specific to adaptive lighting, or even to lighting.

`scene_entity_id` is required - if you don't have a candidate scene this tick, skip calling the service
entirely rather than passing nothing. You already know the answer without asking: every target entity is
uncovered.

```yaml
action: flare.compute_scene_coverage
data:
  scene_entity_id: scene.kitchen_night
  scope_entities: [light.kitchen_1, light.kitchen_2, light.kitchen_strip_effect]
  target_entities: [light.kitchen_1, light.kitchen_2]
response_variable: coverage
# coverage.scene_active / scene_valid / covered_entities / uncovered_entities
```

## When someone takes a light by hand

Nothing special happens. The light stops matching FLARE's recorded claim, so it
classifies as `overridden` and is excluded from the next tick — see
[override protection](../reference/#override-protection).

Switching it **off** by hand counts too: that's a choice like any other, so FLARE leaves it
off rather than relighting it on the next tick. It comes back under FLARE's control once
every light in its tracking scope is off, when the device drops and reconnects, or when
you press that scope's **Clear** button.
