/**
 * Browser port of custom_components/flare/schedule/curve.py.
 *
 * This exists so the docs site's interactive playground can recompute the
 * schedule live as you drag a slider. The real Lovelace card never does this
 * - it reads a precomputed `points` attribute off the sensor, which the
 * integration fills in from curve.py itself (see coordinator.py's
 * _compute_curve_points). So this file feeds the *real* card the same shape
 * of data a live Home Assistant would, rather than reimplementing the card.
 *
 * Being a second implementation of the schedule, it can drift from curve.py.
 * tests/test_curve_js_parity.py runs this module under node against a grid
 * of inputs and asserts every value matches curve.py exactly, so drift fails
 * CI rather than silently leaving the docs graph wrong.
 *
 * Two different rounding rules are deliberate, not an inconsistency:
 *   - brightness/Kelvin use pyRound (half-to-EVEN), because curve.py rounds
 *     them with Python's built-in round(), which is banker's rounding.
 *   - kelvinToRgb uses Math.round (half-UP), because curve.py rounds *it*
 *     with floor(x + 0.5) specifically to match the dashboard card's JS.
 * Getting either backwards produces off-by-one values on exact .5 ties only
 * - invisible by eye, caught by the parity test.
