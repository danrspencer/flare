# FLARE

**F**lexible **L**ighting **A**utomation & **R**econciliation **E**ngine.

Your lights, matched to the shape of your day — bright and cool to help you wake up, gradually warming through
the afternoon, dimming to a relaxed glow as evening sets in, and low and warm once the house is asleep. Rooms
turn their lights on and off as people come and go, manual changes are left alone until you're done with them,
and anything a scene already has covered is left to the scene.

## 📖 [Read the documentation](https://danrspencer.github.io/flare/)

The quickest way to see what this actually does is the
**[interactive curve playground](https://danrspencer.github.io/flare/playground/)** — it runs the
real dashboard card, and you can drag the schedule and curve settings around and watch it redraw.

- **[Quickstart](https://danrspencer.github.io/flare/installation/)** — HACS, the blueprint, and the dashboard
- **[Dashboard](https://danrspencer.github.io/flare/dashboard/)** — the two ready-made views, added with a few lines of config
- **[Power users](https://danrspencer.github.io/flare/advanced/)** — every service and entity, scene handoff, and building without the blueprint
- **[Blueprint reference](https://danrspencer.github.io/flare/blueprint/)** — every input, feature by feature
- **[Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — repository layout and the test suite

## Why four phases, not a continuous curve

Adaptive lighting usually computes one continuous curve from the sun's position — brightness and colour
temperature interpolated smoothly between sunrise and sunset. That follows the daylight closely, but the
daylight isn't your schedule, and the two drift furthest apart in the months you spend most of the day indoors.
FLARE works from your schedule instead, using four named phases, each with a job of its own:

- **Morning** is there to help you wake up, so it starts at a fixed time before you'd normally be up rather than
  moving with sunrise — the same wake-up light in December as in June. Bright, cool-white light in the morning
  has been linked to better alertness later in the day: [one small study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36058557/)
  found twelve students given 1.5 hours of bright morning light (1000 lux at 6500 K) for a working week had
  higher sleep efficiency than under regular office lighting (300 lux at 4000 K).
- **Day** is the long middle stretch, gradually warming as it runs toward evening so the eventual transition
  doesn't feel abrupt.
- **Evening** is when relaxed, warm lighting takes over — the one phase that *does* track the sun (sunset), so
  your indoor lighting shifts in step with what's actually happening outside. It's clamped between an earliest
  and latest bound, though, so a 4pm winter sunset doesn't start the evening while you're still at work, and a
  10pm midsummer sunset doesn't mean evening never really arrives.
- **Night** isn't tied to any solar event at all — it's just what the house should look like once everyone's
  asleep: dim and warm, the lighting you want on at 3am without waking yourself up further.

## The two pieces

Installed separately. The integration stands alone; the blueprint does not.

**FLARE** is a Home Assistant integration. It exposes the phase schedule above, plus
per-light grouping (reachability, tolerance, override protection, two-step transitions, optional RGB colour) and
scene-coverage gap filling, as plain Home Assistant services — `compute_lighting_groups`, `compute_curve` and
`compute_scene_coverage` are pure planners that hand back data; `apply_lighting` wraps the same grouping logic
and actually turns lights on and off. All usable from your own automations with no blueprint required.

**The blueprint** is a ready-made room automation built on those services. It depends on them entirely and
does nothing without them — it's a worked example rather than a separate product, wiring the services up the
way most rooms want them so you can get going without writing anything. Brightness and colour temperature
follow the phase schedule, motion controls on/off, scenes can take over partially or entirely, manual changes
are respected, and lights that don't reach their target get corrected automatically. And because it's a
blueprint it isn't a black box: take it, change it, or rip it apart to build something different on the same
services.
