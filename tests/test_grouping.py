# left exactly alone, even if it doesn't match the current adaptive
# target - regardless of *what* changed it (a person, another
# automation with no context.user_id of its own, a device regaining
# power, or a different owner_id entirely) - checked fresh against live
# state on every call, so nothing needs to be remembered here or
# explicitly expired. build_groups' own owner_id defaults to None,
# which skips this check altogether (every light is free to manage) -
# the explicit force path, tested separately below.
#
# The tests below through test_turning_the_light_off_ends_the_protection
# all use only `confirmed_*` - the steady-state case where there's no
# outstanding, unverified write in flight, which is the vast majority of
# ticks. The *promotion* behaviour itself - how a `pending` claim earns
# its way into `confirmed`, and how `confirmed` survives any number of
# consecutive dropped writes along the way - is a property of
# write_tracking.LastWriteTracker.async_record, not of this pure check,
# so it's exercised end-to-end against a real Store in
# tests/integration/test_services.py instead. What belongs here is
# narrower: given a specific {confirmed, pending} snapshot, does the
# check land on the right answer - see the "Confirmed vs pending" tests
# right after this section for that.


# --- EntityLookup.externally_set(): the adapter, not the decision table ---
#
# The decision table itself lives in override_protection.classify()/
# is_blocked() and is exercised directly in tests/test_override_protection.py,
# which is where cases about *what a claim means* belong. Re-walking that
# table through build_groups() costs ~25 lines per case to assert one
# boolean and proves nothing extra.
#
# What can only be tested here is the wiring: that externally_set() builds
# both claim dicts with every field classify() reads, and that build_groups()
# then drops an excluded entity from every bucket. That wiring has its own
# failure mode - it shipped once with the `observed` dict missing `target`
# and `secondary_context_id`, which left two correct fixes silently inert in
# production while every pure test still passed.

#    against a flat 6667 K Morning target. 132 K apart and not
#    mired-equivalent (floor(1e6/6535)=153 vs floor(1e6/6667)=149), so the
#    bulb sat at its ceiling and was re-commanded every tick, all phase.
#    HA does not clamp color_temp_kelvin for a natively COLOR_TEMP light -
#    the device does (confirmed against light/__init__.py).
#  - Narrowed only: light.utility_spot_1 advertises max 4000 K while
#    happily reporting 5813 K. Its advertised range simply isn't honest,
#    and comparing against 4000 would re-command it every tick instead.
