               via device_of, so an entity with no device (or a device
               id absent from this dict) reports (None, None).
    observed_context_ids: {entity_id: value} - what
               write_tracking.LastWriteTracker would report as the
               "observed" claim for that entity - a write some earlier
               call actually observed landing. Absent means no confirmed
               write yet for that entity.
    latest_context_ids: {entity_id: value} - the
               "latest" claim - the most recent write attempted, not yet
               verified either way. Absent means no attempt is currently
               outstanding.

               that claim (an off-command, or a claim write_tracking
               only observed rather than issued).
    latest_secondary_context_ids / observed_secondary_context_ids:
               {entity_id: value} - the *second* context.id a two-step
               transition's own brightness-only step gets (see
               write_tracking.py's async_record). Absent means that
               claim only has the one (primary) context, same as any
               combined-write claim.
