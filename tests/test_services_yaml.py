"""
services.yaml is user-facing: Home Assistant renders these field
descriptions inline in the service-call UI, so both compute_lighting_groups
and apply_lighting genuinely need their own full copy - deduplicating them
with a YAML anchor would save ~150 lines but leaves a phantom top-level key
(HA reads every top-level key as a service name) and makes a reference file
you read top-to-bottom into one you have to jump around.

So the duplication stays, and this guards it instead: the fields that are
meant to be identical must actually stay identical, and the two that are
meant to differ are named explicitly rather than silently tolerated.
CLAUDE.md already records these copies drifting apart once.
