"""
Integration tests exercise the real Home Assistant event loop, template
engine, and automation/blueprint machinery via pytest-homeassistant-
custom-component - unlike tests/test_curve.py and tests/test_grouping.py
(plain unit tests of the pure logic, with no HA event loop or fixtures).

This is a separate, heavier suite for exactly that reason: it catches
what the pure-logic tests structurally cannot - bugs in how HA's own
trigger/condition/template engine behaves (e.g. `trigger` not being in
scope inside a template trigger's own value_template - the recovered
trigger's dead-on-arrival bug), and bugs in the HA-glue layer
(services.py's service registration, write_tracking.py's Store
persistence, context propagation).

Requires pytest-homeassistant-custom-component, which pins a specific
Home Assistant release and, transitively, the Python version that
release needs - this repo's whole floor (pyproject.toml's
requires-python) tracks that, rather than running a broader
lowest-common-denominator matrix for code that only ever runs inside a
real HA install anyway.
