"""
Integration tests for blueprints/automation/danspencer/flare.yaml
itself - through a real Home Assistant automation/blueprint/template-
trigger engine, not just YAML parsing or isolated template snippets.

This is the only place that can catch bugs living in the blueprint's own
trigger/condition/action wiring - both real incidents this suite exists
to guard against were exactly that kind of bug, invisible to
tests/test_grouping.py and tests/test_curve.py (pure logic, no HA at
all) or to a plain YAML/template sanity check (syntactically fine,
wrong at runtime):

1. The `recovered` trigger's value_template referenced `trigger.*`
   inside itself, which is never in scope during a template trigger's
   own arming evaluation - it could never fire, in any room, from the
   moment it shipped.
2. Once fixed, `apply_lighting` was found to turn on any off light
   whenever *any* non-motion/non-manual tick ran (adaptive, extra, or
   the now-working recovered) - never caught before because recovered
   never ran at all.

Organised to mirror docs/blueprint.md's own section headings, one test
class per feature - read top to bottom, this file is meant to double as
a spec of what the blueprint actually does, not just a regression net
for the two incidents above.

Doesn't re-prove grouping.py's own tolerance/two-step/RGB logic (see
tests/test_grouping.py) or curve.py's brightness/Kelvin math (see
tests/test_curve.py) - `flare.apply_lighting` is
mocked here via async_mock_service, so these tests are entirely about
what the blueprint decides to call it *with*, for a given trigger and
room state.

    plus reconcile (time_pattern, every 5 minutes by default). Without
    controlling wall-clock time, any test whose setup-plus-assertion
    window happens to straddle a real minute boundary can have one of
    these fire for real mid-test - reproduced locally at roughly 5%
    failure rate for
    TestRecoveredTrigger.test_a_plain_off_to_on_transition_does_not_fire_it,
    which asserts apply_lighting_calls == [] and has no way to
    distinguish "nothing fired" from "the periodic tick happened to
    fire too".

    A first attempt just did `with freeze_time(dt_util.utcnow()):` file-
    wide, no `real_asyncio`. That made things *worse*, not better -
    confirmed live in CI (a real `adaptive_tick`-triggered call showed up
    in two unrelated tests' assertions the very first run after shipping
    it) and reproduced in isolation afterward: without
    `real_asyncio=True`, freezegun also mocks the clock asyncio's own
    event loop uses for scheduling (`time.monotonic`), and a real running
    loop with real pending `TimerHandle`s (every `time_pattern` trigger
    registers one) doesn't tolerate that - `asyncio.sleep()` under a bare
    freeze in this harness hangs forever (loop time never advances to
    reach the target), and a `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` test
    run this way logged asyncio's own "Executing <Task ...> took
    1785461732.472 seconds" slow-callback warning - noise on the order of
    56 *years*, from the loop's before/after clock reading falling out of
    sync across the freeze boundary. `real_asyncio=True` is freezegun's
    documented fix for exactly this: it freezes `datetime.now()`/
    `time.time()` (which is all the blueprint's own templates and
    `dt_util.utcnow()` calls need) while leaving the event loop's own
    timer bookkeeping on the real clock, restored to ordinary,
    predictable behaviour.

    With the event loop back on real time, a `time_pattern` trigger's
    real firing is back to depending on genuine elapsed wall-clock
    seconds between registration and whatever matching boundary comes
    next - which is exactly the original risk this fixture exists to
    close off. Freezing at a fixed anchor a couple of seconds *past* the
    current minute (rather than at `dt_util.utcnow()` verbatim, which
    could itself land arbitrarily close to a boundary) makes that gap
    deterministic and always large: at least ~58 real seconds until
    `adaptive_tick` could next fire, comfortably longer than this whole
    file's total real run time (a few seconds, single-digit at most) -
    not just this one test's.

    A test that needs elapsed time to actually pass takes this same
    fixture by name and calls `.tick()`/`.move_to()` on it directly,
    rather than opening its own nested freeze_time (see TestSelfHealing)
    - freezegun's nesting support is real, but there's no reason to rely
    on it when the outer freeze is already available fixture-wide."""

        Deliberately does not try to also prove the delayed call
        eventually lands - that's HA core's own `delay:` mechanism,

        establishes. Proving "and later resolves" needs genuinely
        waiting out real elapsed time or force-firing the delay's own
        timer, and both turned out to be unreliable in this exact test
        harness once the file gained its file-wide `frozen_time` fixture
        (`real_asyncio=True`) from a different session mid-flight:
        - A real, nonzero `await asyncio.sleep(...)` in the test's own
          coroutine (not an HA-tracked task) hung indefinitely -
          confirmed with a minimal repro outside this test.
        - `hass.async_block_till_done()` (which normally blocks on every
          task HA is tracking until it genuinely finishes) intermittently
          returned early, with the delayed call never having landed -
          confirmed by running this test's own earlier draft repeatedly,
          not a one-off.
        - Force-firing the delay's own real timer with a second
          `async_fire_time_changed` call (the mechanism every
          `time_pattern` trigger in this file is normally force-fired
          with) works for `adaptive`, but not `adaptive_tick`: once the
          mock clock has been pushed past one minute boundary to fire
          the tick, a later `async_fire_time_changed` call can *also*
          match the freshly-rescheduled next boundary, causing a second,
          spurious `mode: restart` - confirmed live via the trace log
          showing an unwanted second "Restarting", not just reasoned
          about.
        `await asyncio.sleep(0)` (zero-length) does not hang under the
        same repro - likely routed via `call_soon`, not `call_later` +
        `select()` - so it's used below only to let the automation's
        task start and reach its own delay step, never to wait out real
        elapsed time."""
