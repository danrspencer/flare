"""
State devices - the user-configured tracking scopes that own the
override-protection claims.

A light's scope is whatever tracking_device_id a caller names on it
(apply_lighting/claims_record/etc), never resolved from the entity's own
area or device - see write_tracking.py's module docstring. These cover
that a light lives in exactly one scope no matter how many callers name
it, and that the scope's entities really are the storage rather than a
view kept in step with something else.
