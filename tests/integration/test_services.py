"""
Integration tests for the flare services
(services/handlers.py), through a real Home Assistant instance - this is the
HA-glue layer that tests/test_grouping.py and tests/test_curve.py
can't reach at all (they exercise grouping.py/curve.py directly via
fakes, never services/handlers.py's service registration, sensor reading,
context propagation, or write_tracking.py's real Store persistence).

Deliberately doesn't re-prove grouping.py's own tolerance/two-step/RGB
routing logic - that's tests/test_grouping.py's job, already thorough.
These tests are about the wiring: does apply_lighting actually call
light.turn_on/turn_off with the right data, does a bad sensor raise the
right error, does override protection actually survive a real
Store round-trip.
