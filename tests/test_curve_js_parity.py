"""
Guards the docs site's JS port of curve.py against drift.

docs/assets/js/curve.js is a second implementation of the schedule,
written so the docs site's interactive playground can recompute the
curve live in the browser as a slider moves (the real Lovelace card
never does that - it reads a precomputed `points` attribute produced by
curve.py itself). Two implementations of the same math is exactly the
setup where one quietly stops matching the other, so this runs the JS
under node against a grid of inputs and asserts every single value is
identical to what curve.py returns.

The grid deliberately includes exact .5 ties in the brightness and Kelvin
ramps, because the two languages disagree there by default: Python's
round() is half-to-EVEN, JS's Math.round() is half-UP. curve.js has a
pyRound() for those ramps for that reason, and swapping it for Math.round
is a silent off-by-one on ties only - invisible by eye, and verified
here (mutating it fails this test).

kelvin_to_rgb is the documented exception, and this test does NOT pin its
tie-breaking rule - because nothing can. Its three channels come out of
log/pow, and an exact .5 was searched for and does not occur anywhere in
1000-20000K at integer steps, nor on a 0.01K grid across 1000-10000K. So
half-up and half-to-even are indistinguishable for it in practice, and
curve.py's floor(x + 0.5) is belt-and-braces rather than load-bearing.
What the 1K-step RGB sweep below *does* pin is the algorithm itself: a
changed coefficient or a changed branch that moves any channel by a whole
integer fails it. Changes smaller than that (a 12th-significant-figure
coefficient tweak) or ones the 0-255 clamp absorbs (the temp<=19 blue
cutoff and the temp<=66 red one are both continuous - the alternative
branch clamps to the same value) pass, correctly: they are not observable
differences in what a light is actually told to do.

Skips (rather than fails) when node isn't installed, so the pure-Python
test layer still runs on a machine without it. CI's ubuntu-latest runner
has node preinstalled, so it does run there.
